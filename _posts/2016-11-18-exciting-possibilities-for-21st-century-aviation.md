excerpt: >
  On Nov 4, the Philosophical Society hosts Jaiwon Shin for a confluence of
  seemingly unrelated technologies developed outside the aerospace industry has
  opened up exciting new prospects for aviation in the 21st Century.  NASA is
  focusing on six strategic areas to develop these technologies to meet the
  needs of 21st Century aviation.  There areas span a wide range of efforts to
  develop subsonic aircraft that utilize unconventional structures, electrically
  propelled aircraft, vertical lift aircraft, low boom supersonic aircraft,
  hypersonic aircraft, unmanned and autonomous aircraft ("UAS", "drones") and
  UAS traffic management solutions.

The [Philosophical Society of Washington](http://www.philsoc.org/)
Lectures are selected to
appeal to those with a general interest in science and do not require
a specialized knowledge of the subject. They always contain
information that is current, explanations that are understandable
and a few controversial issues to be challenged by a critical
listener. The series is designed as much as possible to include a
wide range of disciplines.

The meetings are open to the public, free, and no reservations are
required. Dress is informal. Meetings are followed by lively
conversation. All must exit the Cosmos Club at 10:30 p.m.
Conversations are continued at another location.

A confluence of seemingly unrelated technologies developed outside the aerospace
industry has opened up exciting new prospects for aviation in the 21st Century.
NASA is focusing on six strategic areas to develop these technologies to meet
the needs of 21st Century aviation.  There areas span a wide range of efforts to
develop subsonic aircraft that utilize unconventional structures, electrically
propelled aircraft, vertical lift aircraft, low boom supersonic aircraft,
hypersonic aircraft, unmanned and autonomous aircraft ("UAS", "drones") and UAS
traffic management solutions.

For instance, the confluence of newly developed technologies in GPS, electric
power systems, autonomous systems, and communications is propelling a seemingly
unlimited number of applications of small unmanned aerial vehicles in low
altitude airspaces that is regulated but remains largely uncontrolled.  NASA is
involved in research on UAS and in developing ways to manage UAS to ensure that
their benefits are realized while keeping airspaces safe for all.

The combination of rapid advances in composite materials, digital controls,
electric generation, propulsion and storage systems, is leading to far more
fuel-efficient, less polluting, and more comfortable aircraft that are likely to
look very different from today’s large transport category airplanes.  NASA is
working on novel and often unconventional aircraft design that leverage these
developments for safer and greener subsonic aircraft propelled by conventional
engines and entirely new aircraft driven in part or entirely by electric motors.

NASA's new X-plane initiatives are a crucial aspect of its efforts to develop
and implement these new technologies in ways that will facilitate the creation
of new types of airplanes to meet future worldwide demand for environmentally
sound, inherently safe, efficient, economical and comfortable aircraft.  This
lecture will discuss these initiatives and the newly invigorated X-plane
program.

Jaiwon Shin is the Associate Administrator for the Aeronautics Research Mission
Directorate. He guides strategy and manages NASA's broad aeronautics portfolio,
ranging from fundamental aeronautics, to safety, to the nation’s airspace system
as a whole.  He co-chairs the National Science & Technology Council’s
Aeronautics Science & Technology Subcommittee, and he has been deeply involved
in setting national policy for aeronautics research and development.  He was
instrumentally involved in developing Executive Order 13419 setting out
priorities for national aeronautics R&D programs through 2020, and the Research,
Development, Test and Evaluation Infrastructure policy directive currently being
formulated.

The John Wesley Powell Auditorium is adjacent to the Cosmos Club, 2170 Florida
Avenue NW, Washington DC 20008. Entrance is through the club gate, the first
right-hand entrance on Florida Avenue north of the intersection with
Massachusetts Avenue NW. The auditorium entrance is to the left of the gate.
