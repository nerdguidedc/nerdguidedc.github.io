The [Philosophical Society of Washington](http://www.philsoc.org/)
Lectures are selected to
appeal to those with a general interest in science and do not require
a specialized knowledge of the subject. They always contain
information that is current, explanations that are understandable
and a few controversial issues to be challenged by a critical 
listener. The series is designed as much as possible to include a
wide range of disciplines.

The meetings are open to the public, free, and no reservations are
required. Dress is informal. Meetings are followed by lively
conversation. All must exit the Cosmos Club at 10:30 p.m.
Conversations are continued at another location.

#### The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope Dynamically Mapping the Universe in HD

Steven M. Kahn  
Kirk Professor of Physics  
Director, LSST Project  
Stanford University  

The goal of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) project is to
conduct a 10-year survey of the sky that will deliver a 200 petabyte
set of images and data products that will address some of the most
pressing questions about the structure and evolution of the universe
and the objects in it. The LSST survey is designed specifically to
advance science in four particular areas: Dark Matter and Dark Energy;
Hazardous Asteroids and the Remote Solar System; the Transient Optical
Sky, and the Formation and Structure of the Milky Way.

While the LSST is designed to address profound scientific questions,
the technical concept behind the project is remarkably simple: conduct
a deep survey over an enormous area of sky, do it with a frequency that
enables images of every part of the visible sky to be obtained every
few nights, and continue in this mode for ten years creating vast
astronomical catalogs, thousands of times larger than any previously
compiled.

As planned, the LSST will detect over three billion galaxies, providing
detailed measurements of their red shifts, shapes, and properties.
Through a technique called weak gravitational lensing, these data will
be used to map the structure of dark matter in the universe and to show
how the structure of dark matter has evolved with cosmic time. The
results will provide very sensitive constraints on the nature of dark
matter and dark energy. The LSST will also provide crucial data on the
structure of the outer regions of the Milky Way, make a census of
moving objects in the solar system, and discover transient phenomena
in the universe on a wide range of timescales.

The 8.4-meter LSST will use a special three-mirror design that provides
an exceptionally wide field of view and has the ability to survey the
entire sky in only three nights. Its solid state detectors will contain
more than three billion pixels to take advantage of this extremely wide
field of view and the high-quality images produced by the optical
design. The camera is designed to extremely high quality data over
long period so time with minimal maintenance requirements and downtime.

The extremely wide field of view, large pixel count, high dynamic range
and exquisite sensitivity of the optical train and detector electronics
will produce more than 30 terabytes of high quality data every night.
Over time it will produce the largest non-proprietary data set in the
world. Storing and analyzing the data poses challenging hardware and
software problems that constitute one of the most challenging aspects
of the project.

This lecture will discuss the scientific roots of the LSST project,
its support, optical and detector design, supporting computational
hardware and software, current progress on the lens, telescope and
facilities, the initial observations that are planned, and the results
that are expected, including some hoped for surprises.

The John Wesley Powell Auditorium is adjacent to the Cosmos Club,
2170 Florida Avenue NW, Washington DC 20008. Entrance is through 
the club gate, the first right-hand entrance on Florida Avenue north
of the intersection with Massachusetts Avenue NW. The auditorium
entrance is to the left of the gate.
