C. Alex Young will present "A Space Weather Report: Preparing Space Explorers
for Bad Weather Throughout the Solar System." Young is the associate director
for science in the Heliophysics Science Division at NASA's Goddard Space Flight
Center.

The space around our planet may seem empty, but it isnâ€™t, according to Young.
The solar wind, magnetic storms and other phenomena emanating from our sun and
other stars can threaten space travelers and NASA must keep an eye out for this
space weather.

The event will be held in the Pickford Theater on third floor of the Madison
Building.
