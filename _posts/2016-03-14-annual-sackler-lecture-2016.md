The ocean represents a complex, adaptive, coupled human-natural system.
Unprecedented changes in the ocean and human uses present very
significant challenges to sustainable use of the ocean. From collapsing
fisheries to dead zones and ocean acidification, from coral bleaching
to plastic pollution, the news is seemingly hopeless. But bubbling up
from countries around the world are innovative, science-based solutions
that are proving successful in addressing many of the key problems.
The big questions are: Are these solutions scalable? What are the
enabling conditions for these solutions to become the norm? Can they
work in light of climate change and ocean acidification? How can
institutions become more nimble? What science and monitoring are
needed to inform these solutions?

**Jane Lubchenco** is a marine ecologist and environmental scientist with
expertise in oceans, biodiversity, climate change, and interactions
between the environment and human well-being. She was Administrator
of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
from 2009 - 2013. She has returned to Oregon State University and also
serves as the first U.S. Science Envoy for the Ocean. With a Ph.D. in
ecology from Harvard University, she is one of the “most highly cited”
ecologists in the world; eight of her publications are “Science
Citation Classics”. She is an elected member of the National Academy
of Sciences, among others. She was president of the American
Association for Advancement of Science (AAAS) and served on the Pew
Oceans Commission, the Joint Oceans Commission Initiative, Council of
Advisors for Google Ocean and the Blue Ribbon Panel for the World
Bank’s Global Partnership for Oceans. Dr. Lubchenco has received
numerous awards including a MacArthur “genius” award and 19 honorary
doctorates.

The Annual Sackler Public Lecture is free and open to the public,
however [reservations are required](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/2016-annual-sackler-lecture-enough-with-the-doom-and-gloom-holistic-approaches-bring-hope-for-tickets-21209750936) and attendees must present government
issued photo identification (drivers license, state ID, passport, etc.)
for admittance. The lecture is presented in conjunction with the
Sackler Colloquium Coupled Human and Environmental Systems being held
March 14 - 15 in Washington D.C.
