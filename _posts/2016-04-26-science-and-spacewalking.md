U.S. Air Force Academy graduate, "Wings of Blue" parachute team competitor,
flight surgeon, International Space Station scientist, spacewalker -
NASA astronaut Kjell Lindgren, M.D., is all this and more. Recently returned
from five months in space on ISS Expeditions 44 and 45, Lindgren will discuss
what's new in space station research, like the Veggie salad garden, and
what's not so new that now needs maintenance, repair, or replacement.
Lindgren will also return to the Museum the two special objects he borrowed
to fly with him as mementos. A graduate of Robinson Secondary School in
nearby Fairfax, Virginia, Lindgren is on his first trip home to this area
since landing back on planet Earth. The event is part of the Air and Space
Museum's [What's New in Aerospace](http://airandspace.si.edu/explore-and-learn/whats-new-aerospace/) lecture series.
