‘Rocks’ from space have had a profound influence on the evolution of Earth –
from the giant impact that created the Moon, to the asteroids that killed off
the dinosaurs and, more locally, created the Chesapeake Bay, to tiny grains that
may have brought prebiotic molecules that helped kick start life on Earth. The
rate at which the Earth has accreted material from space has decayed
dramatically since it formed. Nevertheless, ignoring the occasional large
‘hiccup’, some 30-40 thousand tons of extraterrestrial material fall to Earth
every year as meteorites and cosmic dust. This has been a boon to science,
providing samples of other stars and Mars, helping to develop our picture of the
timescales and conditions at the birth of our Solar System, and providing
constraints for how the terrestrial planets formed. In this talk, Alexander will
review where and how meteorites and cosmic dust are collected, and what they
have taught us about the origin and early evolution of our Solar System. Doors
open at 6 p.m. Lecture Hall seating is first come, first serve. Eventbrite
tickets are not required, so please arrive early to reserve your seat.

The Broad Branch Road Neighborhood Lectures provide an opportunity to get up
close and personal with Carnegie scientists at our campus in northwest
Washington DC. These lectures begin at 6:30 p.m. and last for approximately one
hour, followed by a brief question and answer period. Doors open to the public
at 6:00 p.m. with light refreshments. The campus is located at the intersection
