The final Friends of the Arlington Planetarium Weekend of the season will be
about planets.

We are going to have live presentations by two renowned researchers and science
communicators, exciting full-dome movies, and a hands-on educational activity
for children. It’s all happening in just two weeks: June 17 – 19. [Check
here](http://friendsoftheplanetarium.org/planets/) on June 10th to make
reservations and purchase tickets. Or become a member of Friends of the
Planetarium to get a secret advance email and the chance to buy tickets before
the general public: as early as June 5th.

Here are some of the events to look forward to:

**Dynamic Earth**  
Friday 6:30 pm

Dynamic Earth explores the inner workings of Earth’s great life support system:
the global climate. With visualizations based on satellite monitoring data and
advanced supercomputer simulations, this cutting-edge production follows a trail
of energy that flows from the Sun into the interlocking systems that shape our
climate: the atmosphere, oceans, and the biosphere. Audiences will ride along on
swirling ocean and wind currents, dive into the heart of a monster hurricane,
come face-to-face with sharks and gigantic whales, and fly into roiling
volcanoes.

**Michael Neufeld Lecture: “How We Got To Pluto”**  
Friday 7:30 pm

Dr. Michael J. Neufeld is a Senior Curator at the Smithsonian Air & Space Museum
in the Division of Space History. He’s going to talk about the difficult birth
of NASA’s mission to Pluto, New Horizons. A version of his interesting
presentation about the institutional politics and battles over funding for space
exploration appeared as the cover story for the April, 2016 Physics Today.

**Full Dome Movie: Exploding Universe**  
Saturday 6:30 pm

From supernovas to volcanoes, this film looks at the beautiful and creative
power of explosive phenomena to shape planets, stars, and the entire universe.

**Heidi Hammel Lecture: “Exploring the Solar System with the Hubble Space
Telescope”**  
Saturday 7:30 pm

Astronomer Heidi Hammel is a self-professed Hubble Hugger and long-time Hubble
user. She has been profiled by the New York Times and Newsweek Magazine, and was
identified as one of the 50 most important women in science by Discover Magazine
in 2002. Dr. Hammel, a long-time user of Hubble for planetary studies, will give
us a broad overview of the many observations Hubble has made: colliding comets;
active aurorae; Martian storms; moons of distant Pluto; dynamic Neptune; and
much more.

**Perfect Little Planet**  
Sunday 1:30 pm

Fly over the surface of Pluto, dive down the ice cliffs of Miranda, sail through
the rings of Saturn, feel the lightning storms at Jupiter and walk on the
surface of Mars. This full dome movie is suitable for all ages, and a favorite
of younger children.

**Measure the Solar System**

Between the two Sunday afternoon films, we’ll offer a hands-on activity for
children that will teach them about the sizes of the planets and the distances
between objects in the Solar System.

**Magic Tree House: Space Mission**  
Sunday 3:00 pm

Travel with the brother-sister duo Jack and Annie in their Magic Tree House® as
they proceed to answer the questions left for them in a mysterious note signed
“-M.” The show begins with narration by Mary Pope Osborne, author of the
best-selling Magic Tree House® children’s book series. Viewers will find
themselves perched high in the trees as Jack and Annie discover the note that
asks them to answer a series of six questions about space. Magic Tree House®
Space Mission is best suited for ages 5 to 12 and their families. Older children
familiar with the book series may also enjoy the show.
