The tax and spending decisions made by Congress and the incoming president over
the next year will affect the outlook for the U.S. economy and, thus, the pace
at which the Federal Reserve raises short-term interest rates from still-low
levels. Many participants in financial markets anticipate expansionary policies
that will raise U.S. interest rates relative to foreign interest rates and will
lead the U.S. dollar to appreciate on foreign exchange markets. How does the
cyclical position of the U.S. economy impact the scope of fiscal policy? Would
the Fed react differently to near-term fiscal stimulus than it would to changes
in taxes and spending that raise the economyâ€™s potential growth rate?  Would the
U.S. be better off if fiscal policy contributed to an increase in the long-term
equilibrium (or natural) interest rate, the rate that will prevail when the
economy is at full employment and prices are stable?

Fed Governor Lael Brainard will discuss the implications of
changes in fiscal policy for monetary policy. Following her remarks, Hutchins
Center Policy Director Louise Sheiner will moderate a conversation between Gov.
Brainard and Donald Kohn, the former Fed vice chairman and the Robert S. Kerr
Senior Fellow in Economic Studies at Brookings. Audience Q&A will follow.
