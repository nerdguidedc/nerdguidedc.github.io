The [Philosophical Society of Washington](http://www.philsoc.org/)
Lectures are selected to
appeal to those with a general interest in science and do not require
a specialized knowledge of the subject. They always contain
information that is current, explanations that are understandable
and a few controversial issues to be challenged by a critical
listener. The series is designed as much as possible to include a
wide range of disciplines.

The meetings are open to the public, free, and no reservations are
required. Dress is informal. Meetings are followed by lively
conversation. All must exit the Cosmos Club at 10:30 p.m.
Conversations are continued at another location.

This talk will present the current "big picture" for the formation and evolution
of life on Earth, with special attention to its astronomical, geological, and
chemical requirements.  Astronomically, there are 1011 stars in our galaxy, each
according to the latest Kepler results likely to have formed its own Earth-sized
planet.  The Universe is 13.8 billion years (Gyr) old, the Galaxy is about 12
Gyr old, our Sun is ~4.6 Gyr old, and high-Z chemical elements took a few
generations of stars to form.  Sol and our solar system are ~2/3 of the way out
from our spiral galaxy’s relatively weak central black hole, in the suburbs so
to speak. The Earth itself is a 4.56 Gyr old, highly differentiated, very unique
object with all its water on the surface, a giant moon stabilizing its spin,
plate tectonics keeping it warm and a shielding magnetic field. Life is found on
the Earth in an incredibly narrow spatial range, -20 to +100 km from the surface
of a body of diameter ~104 km, and is found only where liquid water is
available- we live, work, & die on the thinnest wet rind of the terrestrial
orange. Failed planet harbors for life exist next-door in Venus and Mars.

Historically, the first forms of life appear to have formed in high temperature
environments.  Earth-life was mainly blue-green and single-celled for the first
3.5 Gyr of the planet’s existence.  By ~2 Gyr, in the first massive life-based
pollution event in the planet’s timeline, phototrophic plant life had driven the
atmosphere out of equilibrium, removing almost all CO2 and converting it in the
O2 without which it is likely there would be few animals and no land dwelling
creatures.  Complex multi-cellular life only arrived after ~3.5 Gyr.  Since
then, multi-cellular life has gone through at least 4 huge upheavals due to
giant impacts.  But for these bug-eyed monsters, trilobites, or giant lizards
would be ruling the Earth.  Creatures even remotely resembling Homo Sapiens have
been on the Earth for only ~4 million years (Myr) out of 4.56 Gyr, an ~10-3 duty
cycle.  Even today bacteria are the most successful forms of life reckoned by
total biomass, and we each carry some of this biomass on our skin, in our gut,
and in our mitochondria.

Carey M. Lisse is Senior Research Scientist in the Applied Physics Laboratory
at Johns Hopkins University.  Prior to assuming his current position he held a
variety of posts at APL and NASA.

Carey has been active in the fields of astronomy and physics since 1985, where
he began as an instrument scientist at NASA/Goddard on the Nobel prize winning
COBE project.  He later moved over to planetary studies, writing his
dissertation on comets detected in the COBE all sky survey.  Since then he has
focused primarily on comets, making important discoveries about their X-ray
emissions and working on the NASA Deep Impact mission from start to finish
including using the Spitzer Space Telescope to observe dust excavated from the
comet 9P/Tempel 1 by the DI Impactor.  He also studies asteroids and x-ray
emission from planets, and searches for the presence of asteroids and comets
around other starts.  Casey is the Chair of the Comet ISON Observing Campaign
Team, overseeing the team's activities.

Carey received a number of awards as part of the COBE team, the JPL Stardust
flight team, and the EPOXI flight team.  He is the recipient of a Space
Telescope Science Institute Science Merit Award, a  Space Foundation Space
Achievement Award, a Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory Special
Achievement Award, and he was awarded the Isaac Newton Institute Visiting
Fellowship at Cambridge University.  Carey is a AAAS Fellow.  And the Asteroid
12226 Caseylisse is named for him.

The John Wesley Powell Auditorium is adjacent to the Cosmos Club, 2170 Florida
Avenue NW, Washington DC 20008. Entrance is through the club gate, the first
right-hand entrance on Florida Avenue north of the intersection with
Massachusetts Avenue NW. The auditorium entrance is to the left of the gate.
