excerpt: >
  It is Post Hunt 2016, the annual braintease competition held by
  Washington Post Magazine. Thousands come downtown to solve
  head-scratcher puzzles and vie for a $2,000 grand prize — and to
  watch the inventors, Dave Barry, Tom Shroder and Gene Weingarten,
  race around in Bermuda shorts with maniacal glints in their eyes.
