In *Becoming Wise: An Inquiry into the Mystery and Art of Living*,
Peabody Award-winning broadcaster and National Humanities Medalist
Krista Tippett presents a hopeful vision of humanity for this century.

Tippett has interviewed the most extraordinary voices examining
the great questions of meaning for our time on her national public
radio program and podcast, [On Being](https://www.onbeing.org).
Scientists, theologians, poets, activists, and many others have
opened themselves up in their conversations with Tippett.

What does it mean to be human? What matters in a life? What matters
in a death? How to be of service to each other and the world? As
Tippett explains, “These questions are being reborn in our age of
interdependence with far-flung strangers. The question of what it
means to be human is now inextricable from the question of who
we are to each other. We have riches of knowledge and insight,
of tools both tangible and spiritual, to rise to this calling.”

*Becoming Wise* is a master class in the art of living, focused not
simply on personal growth but on public life and human spiritual
evolution. Tippett reflects on her own journey and learning curve
and draws on conversations with the poet Elizabeth Alexander,
physicist Brian Greene, civil rights veteran John Lewis, chef Dan
Barber, playwright Eve Ensler, Buddhist teacher Joanna Macy,
Brainpickings’ Maria Popova, and essayist Pico Iyer, among others.

In conversation with Guy Raz, the host and editorial director
of TED Radio Hour. A multi award-winning journalist, Raz was
previously the weekend host of NPR’s All Things Considered.
