excerpt: >
  On Dec 2, the Philosophical Society hosts David Kaplan for a crash course on
  particle physics, collider experiments, and quantum field theory.  He will show
  that on the cutting edge of particle physics is the search for the description
  of the vacuum of spacetime and the nature of the laws of physics.  Particle
  colliders are one of a handful of ways to explore these laws, and the worlds
  largest, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) outside of Geneva, Switzerland, will
  have collected unprecedented amounts of data by the time of this lecture,
  revealing answers — and undoubtedly bigger questions — about the nature of
  reality.

The [Philosophical Society of Washington](http://www.philsoc.org/)
Lectures are selected to
appeal to those with a general interest in science and do not require
a specialized knowledge of the subject. They always contain
information that is current, explanations that are understandable
and a few controversial issues to be challenged by a critical
listener. The series is designed as much as possible to include a
wide range of disciplines.

The meetings are open to the public, free, and no reservations are
required. Dress is informal. Meetings are followed by lively
conversation. All must exit the Cosmos Club at 10:30 p.m.
Conversations are continued at another location.

"I will give a crash course on particle physics, collider experiments, and
quantum field theory. I will show that on the cutting edge of particle physics
is the search for the description of the vacuum of spacetime and the nature of
the laws of physics. Particle colliders are one of a handful of ways to explore
these laws, and the worlds largest, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) outside of
Geneva, Switzerland, will have collected unprecedented amounts of data by the
time of this lecture, revealing answers — and undoubtedly bigger questions —
about the nature of reality.  The previous run of the LHC revealed the Higgs
Boson particle. I will explain its significance, its impact on the field, and
the justification for featuring it in a documentary film. I will also tell a
joke that, at best, physicists will find amusing."

David Kaplan is a theoretical particle physicist and professor at Johns Hopkins
University.  He received is A.B. at UC Berkeley and his PhD and the University
of Washington.  Before Hopkins, he held postdoctoral positions at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, the Argonne National Lab, and the University of
Chicago.  Early in his career, he was named a Outstanding Junior Investigator by
the Department of Energy, and later a Fellow of the Sloan Foundation, the Kavli
Foundation, and the American Physical Society.

David Kaplan David also created and produced Particle Fever, a documentary film
about the Large Hadron Collider for which he was nominated for Best Producer by
the Producer's Guild of America, and won a duPont Journalism Award, among other
accolades.  In addition, he has hosted science programs for the History Channel
and National Geographic, and online videos for Quanta Magazine.  He strongly
recommends not being a filmmaker and physicist simultaneously, but continues to
ignore his own advice.

The John Wesley Powell Auditorium is adjacent to the Cosmos Club, 2170 Florida
Avenue NW, Washington DC 20008. Entrance is through the club gate, the first
right-hand entrance on Florida Avenue north of the intersection with
Massachusetts Avenue NW. The auditorium entrance is to the left of the gate.
