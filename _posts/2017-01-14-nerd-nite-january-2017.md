Nerd Nite is a monthly event held in more than 75 cities across the globe
during which several folks give 18-21-minute fun-yet-informative
presentations across all disciplines – while the audience drinks along.
Despite our similar names the Nerd Guide DC and Nerd Nite DC are
unaffiliated but kindred spirits. Doors open at 6:00, show starts
at 6:30. Tickets are $10. More information available at the [Nerd Nite
DC](https://dc.nerdnite.com) website. This is a 21+ event.

### Civil War Shenanigans

We’re ringing in the new year with our old friends at Atlas Obscura and inviting
all of you to be part of the fun. Atlas Obscura is the definitive guide to the
world’s wondrous and curious places. We believe there is something new to
discover, every day, all over the world—and around the corner.

And tonight, we will explore what’s wondrous and curious about the Civil War.
So what are we poking into, you ask?  Well, how about the fortress in the forest
located right here in DC, how legs were amputated on the battlefield and what
missed connections were like in the early 19th century.

Matt Blitz will be the MC for the evening. He heads up Atlas Obscura Society DC.
He’s also a contributing writer for Washingtonian, Popular Mechanics, Arlington
Magazine and Food & Wine. When he’s not planning cemetery adventures,
researching the history of the microwave or exploring Area 51, he’s being bossed
around by his cat.

Oh yeah! Awesome Con is also coming and they told me they were bringing the
goodies for the trivia sessions. It’s going to be a great evening!

***From Live Snakes to Missing Men: Inside the 19th Century Dead Letter Office***

Ashley Bowen-Murphy

When letters went wrong, the Dead Letter Office made them right. In the 19th and
early 20th centuries, this little known department of the Post Office processed
hundreds of thousands of undelivered letters and packages annually. In these
dead letters are moving, fantastic, and unbelievable stories about everything
from live snakes and the hair of a presidential assassin to the personal
tragedies wrapped up as missed connections. In this talk, Bowen-Murphy will
explain the Dead Letter Office’s history and share both funny and sad stories
about the items lost in transit.

Ashley Bowen-Murphy received a PhD in American Studies from Brown
University last month! Her research interests include the history and material
culture of medicine, patient experience, and Civil War veterans. When she’s not
poking around in archives or organizing events as an Atlas Obscura field agent,
you can find her volunteering at the National Postal Museum or reading mystery
novels and blogging about them for Book Riot.

***Get Down You Fool: The Surprising Civil War History of Washington D.C., including the OTHER time they shot at Abe Lincoln***

David Plotz

Take a map of D.C. Draw a circle a few miles from the capitol and you’ll start
to see something weird. Fort Reno. Fort Totten. Fort Dupont. Fort Mahan. Fort
Stevens. Military Road. Battery Kemble. These are the ghostly signs of Civil War
Washington, when the city was a garrison. We’ll explore the almost forgotten
history of D.C. at war, including the tale of the crazy Confederate invasion of
1864 that almost killed Lincoln and defeated the Union. Plus, how to find some
of the city’s best, often-secret Civil War sites, including the fort in the
forest.

David Plotz is the CEO of Atlas Obscura, host of the Slate Political
Gabfest, and a lifelong Washingtonian. Also, he wrote a book about the Nobel
Prize Sperm Bank, which was a real thing.

***Cut-it Off!: A Civil War Amputation***

Amelia Grabowski & Jake Wynn

A rusty saw. A swig of whiskey. A nice bullet to bite on. That’s all you need
for a Civil War amputation, right? Not quite. Jake Wynn and Amelia Grabowski
will demonstrate (yes that’s right DEMONSTRATE) the sometimes fascinating, but
mostly disturbing world of the Civil War operating room where truth is often
stranger than fiction.

Amelia Grabowski is the Education and Digital Outreach Specialist at the
Clara Barton Missing Soldiers Office Museum here in DC, and the National Museum
of Civil War Medicine in Frederick, MD. She once organized a public program
where everyone became a registered 19th-century prostitute. Jake Wynn is the
Program Coordinator at the National Museum of Civil War Medicine and the Clara
Barton Missing Soldiers Office. He is a 2015 graduate of Hood College in
Frederick, Maryland. When he’s not amputating gelatin legs, you can find him
writing at Wynning History Blog.
