excerpt: >
  Twenty-five years ago, a small team of Philippine and US scientists worked
  feverishly to forecast what newly-awakened Mount Pinatubo might do, and to
  alert everyone from indigenous peoples to high tech military about what to
  expect and the possible need to evacuate.  Dr. Chris Newhall, USGS (ret.),
  will highlight the pre-eruption preparation and introduce the eruption, and
  Dr. Renato Solidum, Director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and
  Seismology, will trace events from the eruption through long-lasting lahars.
  The event is Monday evening June 13 at the Carnegie Institute.

Twenty-five years ago, a small team of Philippine and US scientists worked
feverishly to forecast what newly-awakened Mount Pinatubo might do, and to alert
everyone from indigenous peoples to high tech military about what to expect and
the possible need to evacuate.  Skepticism was high and had to be overcome with
a combination of video, hard facts and numbers, and personal trust.
Uncertainties were also high, which required erring on the side of safety and
being willing to be wrong. Dr. Chris Newhall, USGS (ret.), will highlight the
pre-eruption preparation and introduce the eruption, and Dr. Renato Solidum,
Director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology, will trace
events from the eruption through long-lasting lahars.

The event is free and open to the public but [registration is required](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/dr-chris-newhall-dr-renato-solidum-25-years-ago-at-pinatubo-the-forecast-climax-and-aftermath-of-a-registration-24894880257)
