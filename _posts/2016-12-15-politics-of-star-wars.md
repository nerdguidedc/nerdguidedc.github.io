excerpt: >
  On Thursday, December 15, Ilya Somin will be giving a talk on “The Politics of
  Star Wars” for the DC Film Society. Several political issues raised in the
  Star Wars series are highly relevant to recent real-world events, most notably
  the fragility of liberal democracy, and the dangers of widespread voter
  ignorance.

Please join the Cinema Lounge, the DC Film Society’s monthly film discussion
group, at Teaism in Penn Quarter for a [discussion about politics and Star Wars](https://www.film.virginia.org/hotline/post/washington-dc-politics-of-star-wars-with-guest-ilya-somin-dec-15-free/).

Rogue One, the eighth Star Wars film, opens on December 16.  Does the epic film
saga have political messages? Cinema Lounge is honored to be joined by noted
author and George Mason Univeristy Law School Professor Ilya Somin. He has
written and lectured on Star Wars and its politics. Several political issues
raised in the Star Wars series are highly relevant to recent real-world events,
most notably the fragility of liberal democracy, and the dangers of widespread
voter ignorance.
