Three years ago the Fulbright-National Geographic Digital Storytelling
Fellowship was launched as a new component of the U.S. Department of State’s
Fulbright U.S. Student Program in collaboration with the National Geographic
Society to provide opportunities for U.S. citizens to participate in an academic
year of overseas travel, exploration, and storytelling on innovative and
globally significant themes.

Join the second class of Fulbright-National Geographic Storytellers —selected
from hundreds of applicants—as they share insights on the challenges and the
rewards of creating compelling stories from around the world.

You’ll meet *Ryan Bell*, a writer, photographer—and cowboy—who spent time in
Russia and Kazakhstan documenting the rebirth of the cattle ranching industry in
those countries.

*Christina Leigh Geros* is a designer, researcher, and educator whose work lies
at the intersection of urbanism, ecology, and politics, traveled to Jakarta,
Indonesia to take a multi-media look at explore how the city is adapting to
climate change.

As the grandson of the only U.S. serviceman aboard both B-29s that dropped
atomic bombs on Japan during World War II, *Ari Beser* shared stories that
offered a personal and unique voice for the thousands still affected by the
nuclear technology in a year of nuclear anniversaries (Hiroshima and Nagasaki;
Fukushima nuclear disaster) in Japan.

*Janice Cantieri*, a journalist and researcher, spent nine months capturing the
poignant and painful stories of rising seas-induced displacement and adaptation
between the Pacific Island nations of Kiribati and Fiji.

*Hiba Dlewati*, a Syrian American journalist and writer traveled through Jordan,
Turkey, and Sweden to document and narrate the captivating stories of tragedy
and triumph behind the headlines of the Syrian diaspora.

A discussion with the Fellows will follow, and you’ll also hear from Daniel
Koehler, who will share an excerpt from his short documentary, A House Without
Snakes, which the product of his 2014–15 Fulbright-National Geographic
fellowship in Botswana with the San (bushmen).

The program concludes with the first public introduction of the 2016–17 class of
storytellers.
