Join Gallery experts (curators, lecturers, conservators, horticulturists,
and docents) to discover rarely told stories from the Gallery's first
75 years! Stories include the puzzling discovery of an older woman beneath
Fragonard's Young Girl Reading and the clandestine arrival of Leonardo da
Vinci's Ginevra de' Benci (c. 1474/1478) - code-named "the bird."

The [pop-up talks](http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/calendar/adult-programs/special-events/75-years-75-stories.html)
will be scheduled in 30-minute intervals with two or three
taking place at the same time in different areas of the Gallery. Several
talks per day will be offered in accessible formats, including those
with enhanced verbal description and talks interpreted into American Sign Language.

The talks will be April 1 and 2 from 10:30 to 4:00 and April 3 from
11:30 to 4:30. [Download the complete schedule](http://www.nga.gov/content/dam/ngaweb/calendar/gallery-talks/pdfs/75th-pop-up.pdf)
