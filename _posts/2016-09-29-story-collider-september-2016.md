excerpt: >
  Science surrounds us. Even when we don't notice it, science touches
  almost every part of our lives. Story Collider is on September 29, a live
  storytelling project and podcast that believes that everyone has a story to
  tell about science.

---

Join us Thursday, September 29, for five true, personal stories of science. At
the [Story Collider](http://www.storycollider.org/shows/2016/9/29/washington-dc), we
believe that everyone has a story. From the tragic to
the hilarious, we explore the deeply human side of science.

Doors at 7:30, show at 8:00pm. This is a 21+ event. This event is mixed seated and standing, please arrive early for the best seats. Tickets are $15-20.

Stories By:

**Brian Lin** oversees editorial content strategy at EurekAlert!, the "news hub
that shapes the science you read," as described by Wired. As a non-scientist
who makes a living communicating science, he has trained grad students, coached
professors, and advised a MacArthur "genius" and a Nobel laureate. Born and
raised in Taiwan, he chose journalism over theatre because he thought reporters
made a better living than actors. After stumbling into television news, he
promptly moved to the 'dark side' after receiving his Master's in journalism
and worked as a press officer at the University of British Columbia for 13
years before moving to DC to take up his current post with the American
Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). Follow him at @brianlinworks

**Lauren Lipuma** is a science writer at the American Geophysical Union, where
she writes about all areas of Earth and space science, except for space weather
(because no one understands space weather). She has previously written for the
magazines EyeWorld and Ophthalmology Business, worked in conservation, and done
extensive research on the bacteria that make up our poop. She thinks the most
beautiful thing ever written that is not a poem is Joyas Voladoras by Brian
Doyle and the most beautiful thing ever written that is a poem is I carry your
heart with me by E.E. Cummings. Lauren has bachelor’s and master’s degrees in
biomedical engineering from Tulane University and is currently the vice
president of the D.C. Science Writers Association. Follow her at @lipumal.

**Liz Neeley** is the executive director of The Story Collider. She's a marine
biologist by training, and an optimistic worrier by nature. As the oldest of
five children, she specializes in keeping the peace and not telling Mom. After
grad school, Liz stumbled into ocean conservation. She focused on coral reef
management and restoration in Fiji and Papua New Guinea, and dabbled in
international trade policy on deep sea corals. Next, she spent almost a decade
at COMPASS helping scientists understand journalism,  policymaking, and social
media. Follow her at @lizneeley

**Bri Riggio** has spent the last six years working at various institutions of
higher education, from a study abroad program in Greece to George Mason
University, where she now supports the Office of Research at the executive
level. While not a scientist by training, she has always loved research and the
process of learning. She stupidly spent an extra year in graduate school after
choosing to base her Master's thesis on a social science methodology that she
didn't know and just barely managed to finish her MA in Conflict Resolution
this past spring. To keep her sanity, she runs marathons, plays video games,
and looks for opportunities to tell her stories.

**Benjamin Rubenstein** is the author of the "Cancer-Slaying Super Man" books
and other personal essays. He speaks about personal health, feeling superhuman,
and the urge when he's intoxicated to eat jelly beans--all of them. The two
items he brings with him everywhere are a flask and gum, particularly Juicy
Fruit or Big Red because those have sugar instead of sorbitol. Benjamin doesn't
fuck around with weird chemicals (excluding whatever is in cheap whiskey).
Benjamin loves inspiring others through a combination of insane stories of
survival and attempted humor.
