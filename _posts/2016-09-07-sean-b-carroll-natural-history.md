The National Museum of Natural History invites you to attend a special evening
with award-winning scientist, writer, educator, and executive producer, Sean B.
Carroll.

Carroll will explore the stories of pioneering ecologists who discovered the
rules of regulation for animals and plants as he discusses his new book, The
Serengeti Rules.

In a conversation with Kirk Johnson, Sant Director of the National Museum of
Natural History, Carroll will share his bold, thought-provoking view on how
these discoveries matter for our health, and how they are being applied to
restore some of the greatest wildernesses on the planet.

The Serengeti Rules will be available for purchase and signing after the
program.

The event is free and open to the public but [advance registration is
required](http://go.si.edu/site/Calendar?view=Detail&id=101362). Seating
is limited.
