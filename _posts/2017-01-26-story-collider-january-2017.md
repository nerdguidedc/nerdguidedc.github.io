excerpt: >
  Science surrounds us. Even when we don't notice it, science touches
  almost every part of our lives. Story Collider is on January 26, a live
  storytelling project and podcast that believes that everyone has a story to
  tell about science.

Join us Thursday, January 26, for five true, personal stories of science. At
the [Story Collider](http://www.storycollider.org/shows/2017/1/26/washington-dc), we
believe that everyone has a story. From the tragic to
the hilarious, we explore the deeply human side of science.

Doors at 7:30, show at 8:00pm. This event is mixed seated
and standing, please arrive early for the best seats. Tickets are $15-20.

Stories By:

**Yael Fitzpatrick** is an art director, publications designer, sometimes
writer, and science communicator. She spent the first part of her life
concentrating on math and the sciences, and then took an unexpected detour into
the arts. She has since managed to come somewhat full circle. Currently she is
the Manager of Design and Branding for the American Geophysical Union, and
previously was Art Director for the Science family of journals. She has almost
accepted the fact that she will never be a backup singer or dancer. Follow her
at @GazelleInDminor.

**Liz Laribee** is a writer and illustrator. She is the creator of Saved By The
bell hooks, a critical theory humor blog based on a deep interest in pop culture
studies that address racial, gender, and class. She has recently begun
experimenting in the comics world: she illustrated Amira in America, a comic
reference guide for and about refugees in the resettlement process. Her work
also appeared in Colonial Comics, an anthology of undertold narratives
traditionally ignored by history books. Currently, she is a Graduate Assistant
in the College of Information at the University of Maryland where she is
pursuing a master’s in Library and Information Science. You can see her work at
lizlaribee.com or follow her @lizlaribee. She lives in Washington DC, happily.

**Winnie Lau** is an expert on ocean conservation practice and policy.
Currently she supports international efforts on marine environmental protection,
with a focus on engagements in Asia, at a large DC non-profit organization.
Prior to her current position, Winnie served as Climate Change Science and
Technology Adviser for the USAID Mission to Sri Lanka and Maldives, Manager of
the Marine Ecosystem Services Program at Forest Trends, and Foreign Affairs
Officer at the U.S. Department of State. With a doctoral degree in Oceanography
and a graduate certificate in Environmental Management from the University of
Washington, Winnie has been bridging the fields of science and environmental
policy for over a decade. She speaks Cantonese, Mandarin, Japanese, and basic
Spanish.

**Rachel Pendergrass** is the host and producer of the Solve for X Science
Variety Show. She has written for numerous publications as a science writer,
journalist, and humorist, including McSweeneys, HowStuffWorks,
SouthernFriedScience, TEDx, Eater, and more. She is on twitter as
@sharkespearean.

**Shannon Brescher Shea** has loved nature and stories for as long as she can
remember. While she didn't fulfill her elementary school goal of being a marine
biologist in the summer and a famous novelist in the winter, she's pretty close.
Currently, she's a senior writer and editor for the Office of Science in the
U.S. Department of Energy, where she's covered everything from dark matter to
photosynthesis. When she’s not at her day job, raising her two young sons, or
fighting climate change, she writes about her family learning to be kinder, more
sustainable, and more adventurous at her blog We’ll Eat You Up, We Love You So.
She also tweets at @storiteller.
