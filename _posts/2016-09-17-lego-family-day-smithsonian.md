Bring your budding architects to our [LEGO Family Day](http://americanart.si.edu/calendar/event.cfm?trumbaEmbed=view%3Devent%26eventid%3D119936457)
where they can use problem-solving skills and imagination to make works of art
and architecture at our LEGO building stations. Recreate some of our famous
sculptures on display in the galleries, or invent your own new creations! Get
inspired by the USPTOâ€™s LEGO model of our historic building, which was home to
the U.S. Patent Office in the nineteenth century. The model will remain on
public view in our Luce Foundation Center through October 5.
