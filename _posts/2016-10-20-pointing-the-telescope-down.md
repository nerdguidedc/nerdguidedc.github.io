excerpt: >
  The key to life’s evolution on Earth is the development and persistence of
  plate tectonics, a planetary process that affects everything from the mineral
  composition of the continents to the existence of liquid water on Earth’s
  surface. To study the inner workings of our world, we need to point our
  “telescopes” down to look deep into the Earth’s interior to see how plate
  tectonics allows the planet to “breathe” and evolve and, in turn, allows life
  to, also. Dr Lara Wagner is presenting at the Carnegie Institute Neighborhood
  Lecture series on Oct 20.

The key to life’s evolution on Earth is the development and persistence of plate
tectonics, a planetary process that affects everything from the mineral
composition of the continents to the existence of liquid water on Earth’s
surface. To study the inner workings of our world, we need to point our
“telescopes” down to look deep into the Earth’s interior to see how plate
tectonics allows the planet to “breathe” and evolve and, in turn, allows life
to, also.

 Seismology allows us to “see” inside the Earth much like a CAT scan allows a
doctor to see inside a human body. Instead of light waves or X-rays,
seismologists use seismic waves to take “snapshots” of the planet’s interior
structure. This allows us to learn a great deal about both the ancient history
responsible for creating these internal structures, and the ongoing plate
tectonic processes that sustain life, while also producing some of the world’s
most devastating natural disasters.

The ability of seismometers to image the planet’s interior depends on how close
the seismic sensors are to each other and how big of an area the sensors cover.
This talk will show recent examples of high density/broad aperture deployments,
and look at the science potential for the newest generation of seismic
equipment. By sharpening our image of the deep Earth’s interior, we will
understand better what makes our planet special, and what we might expect from
planets we find elsewhere in the cosmos.

The lecture is free and open to the public but registration is strongly
recommended. You can

or call the registration line at 202-478-8900.

The Broad Branch Road Neighborhood Lectures provide an opportunity to get up
close and personal with Carnegie scientists at our campus in northwest
Washington DC. These lectures begin at 6:30 p.m. and last for approximately one
hour, followed by a brief question and answer period. Doors open to the public
at 6:00 p.m. with light refreshments. The campus is located at the intersection
of Broad Branch Road and 32nd Street in northwest Washington, DC. Parking is
available on campus and accessible via Jocelyn and 32nd Streets. Street parking
is permissible. The campus is a short, three-block walk from Connecticut Avenue
and two blocks south of Military Road.
