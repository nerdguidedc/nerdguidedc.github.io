excerpt: >
 But how exoplanets form, and why are they so different from those
 in our own solar system? Which ingredients are available to build 
 them? How and where was the water that is now in our oceans on
 Earth formed? Can these organic molecules end up on new planets
 and form the basis for pre-biotic material and eventually life?

One of the most exciting developments in astronomy is the discovery
of planets around stars other than our Sun. More than a thousand
exoplanets have been detected so far. But how do these planets form,
and why are they so different from those in our own solar system?
Which ingredients are available to build them? Thanks to powerful
new telescopes, astronomers are starting to address these age-old
questions scientifically. Stars and planets are born in the extremely
cold and tenuous clouds between the stars in the Milky Way. These
clouds also contain water and a surprisingly rich variety of
organic material. How and where was the water that is now in our
oceans on Earth formed? Can these organic molecules end up on new
planets and form the basis for pre-biotic material and eventually life?

Ewine F. van Dishoeck, professor of molecular astrophysics at the
Leiden Observatory at Leiden University in the Netherlands and winner
of the 2015 Albert Einstein World Award of Science will discuss these
questions and more at this yearâ€™s John N. Bahcall Lecture.

The event is free but
