Can understanding the Torah, the Bible, and the Qur’an increase empathy and
connections among cultures that are often at odds? [Join a conversation](http://www.asia.si.edu/events/lectures.asp?trumbaEmbed=view%3Devent%26eventid%3D120922809) with
local faith leaders on the similarities and differences among prophetic
traditions in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The stories of Noah, Abraham,
Jonah, Mary, and others play a key role in all three religions. Their stories
are told differently, and the lessons for the faithful are not always the same,
yet all three faiths see themselves as following the tradition of Abraham. In
this interfaith dialogue, an imam, a minister, and a rabbi share the teachings
they take from these ancient tales.

Panel members include Imam Talib Shareef, Rabbi Jack Moline, and Reverend Donald
Isaac.
