excerpt: >
  On Wednesday, June 1, Pamela Conrad, astrobiologist at NASA Goddard Space
  Flight Center and deputy principal investigator for the SAM (Sample Analysis
  at Mars) instrument on the Curiosity rover, will explore some of the
  challenging locales to which life adapts, from the deep sea floor to the edges
  of volcanoes, and look at how this can affect the search for life on Mars.

On Earth, extreme environments where life exists can serve as analogs to help us
better understand and recognize habitable settings elsewhere. Pamela Conrad,
astrobiologist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center and deputy principal
investigator for the SAM (Sample Analysis at Mars) instrument on the Curiosity
rover, will explore some of the challenging locales to which life adapts, from
the deep sea floor to the edges of volcanoes, and look at how this can affect
the search for life on Mars.

The event is free and open to the public but
[advance tickets](http://airandspace.si.edu/events/tickets)
are required.

### Exploring Space Lecture Series

**Life in the Solar System and Beyond**

Exploration of our solar system has revealed a great diversity of
worlds and a variety of unexpected environments. Could they support
simple life? Candidate locations include an ocean of water under
Europa's frigid crust and subsurface regions of Enceladus that have
been tantalizingly revealed by active geysers. New technologies are
enabling the search for worlds with habitable environments beyond
the solar system as well, and on our own planet, extreme environments
where life exists can be studied as planetary analogs. In this
series, four distinguished speakers will describe the latest
developments as we look for life in a lot of strange places.
Exploring Space lectures are suitable for ages 11 and up.
