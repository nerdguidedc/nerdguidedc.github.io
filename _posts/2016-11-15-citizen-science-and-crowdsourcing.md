Citizen Science and Crowdsourcing, a form of open innovation that engages the
public in authentic scientific research, has many documented benefits like
advancing research, STEM education and addressing societal needs. This method
has gained significant momentum in the U.S. Federal government in the past four
years. In September 2015 the White House issued a memorandum asking federal
agencies to report on their citizen science and crowdsourcing projects and
appoint coordinators within each agency. In 2016 we witnessed the launch of
www.citizenscience.gov, a platform with an extensive toolkit on how to conduct
these projects as well as a catalog and community hub. In addition to these
Executive Branch initiatives, a grassroots Federal Community of Practice for
Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science (CCS) has emerged with 300 members across 59
agencies. The Science and Technology Program (STIP) at the Wilson Center has
played a role in encouraging this momentum, providing support through building a
cartographic catalog of federally supported citizen science and crowdsourcing
projects and through extensive research into some of the legal, administrative
and intellectual property concerns for conducting projects within the Federal
government.

However, a new Administration often brings new priorities, and itâ€™s vital to
preserve this momentum and history for new leadership. STIP interviewed twelve
representatives of the Federal Community of practice and Agency Coordinators and
conducted desk research to compile 10 strategic recommendations for advancing
federal policies and programs in citizen science and crowdsourcing to facilitate
the transfer of knowledge on this incredible momentum.

Please join us for a discussion of these recommendations, a celebration of the
history of the movement and a dialogue on the future of citizen science and
crowdsourcing in the Federal government.

This event is free and open to the public but [registration is
required](http://pages.wilsoncenter.org/10.20.2016FutureofFederalCitizenScience_Registration.html).
