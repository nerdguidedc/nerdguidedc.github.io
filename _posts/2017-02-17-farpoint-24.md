Farpoint is an annual gathering for fans of all genres of imaginative fiction
- Science Fiction, Fantasy, Horror, SuperHeroes - in all the media formats
in which they might appear - Cinematic Movies, Television, Direct to DVD,
Books on Tape, Podcasts, Web Video - you name it, we want to celebrate it!

The con was established in 1993, by a committee led by Bev Volker and Steve
Wilson. Our focus is on Fandom, and all the wonderful, creative people who
comprise it. Our mission is to encourage, to educate, to enable. So, while we
certainly bring in some exciting professionals from the industries which
bring imagination into the mainstream, our real goal is to give you the
opportunity to meet others like yourself, to forge friendships, and to
develop your own creative gifts.
