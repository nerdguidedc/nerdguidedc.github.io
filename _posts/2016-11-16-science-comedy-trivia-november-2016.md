DC Science Comedy is pairing up with Specific Ignorance-- a special comedy
trivia/panel show with a twist!

Here's how it works:

Three local comedians compete as a team against the audience, however here's the
catch - each comedian picks one subject, but the audience writes the questions
about the subject the comedian picked. If the audience can think of a question
that the panel of three comedians fail to answer correctly, whoever wrote the
question wins a free shot of whiskey! (Also the audience gets some points...)
If, at the end of the night the audience has accumulated more points than the
panel, as a punishment, the audience will choose one of the comedians to perform
improvised standup comedy based solely on the subject they chose!

Your comic panelists are:

* Kasha Patel, an expert in "sex habits of animals"
* Joe Dawson, an expert in "biology"
* Simone, an expert in "Marie Curie"

Bring your best questions to stump the comedians and get ready to laugh as they
try to come up with answers! We expect this event to sell out so buy your
tickets ($5) early! For information on the Specific Ignorance trivia show, visit
