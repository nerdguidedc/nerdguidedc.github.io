Over the last half century, a number of diseases have spilled over from animals
to humans with increasing frequency. What's behind the rise in spillover
diseases? What can we do to stop them?

PBS documentary  Spillover — Zika, Ebola & Beyond, produced by HHMI Tangled Bank
Studios, is a harrowing documentary that follows scientists into the world's hot
zones in a search for answers. And it does so while providing much needed
scientific context for the most recent Ebola and Zika outbreaks. The film
extends to the new frontiers of disease detection, prevention, and containment,
and travels the world with virus hunters who are tracking old enemies while
vigilantly looking out for new foes.

A discussion after the screening hosted by BBC correspondent and television
presenter Jane O'Brien will focus on Zika and how scientists have tracked the
disease globally and locally, how the disease affects people and what we need to
know to help manage and prevent an outbreak in DC and beyond.

The event is free and open to the public but [advance registration](http://go.si.edu/site/Calendar?id=101463&view=Detail&s_src=nerdguide_web_cal_er) is required.
