The Capitol Fourth concert is an annual tradition on the West Lawn of the
U.S. Capitol building in celebration of Independence Day. On the day of
the concert gates open as early as 3:00 pm and the concert begins at
8:00 pm. If you want to avoid the crowds you can attend a day earlier
where there will be a rehearsal of the concert.
