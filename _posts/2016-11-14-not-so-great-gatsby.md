Mike Canning, a film critic for the Hill Rag, will present "Novels into Films:
Like Apples and Oranges" on Thursday, Oct. 13. Maureen Corrigan, a critic for
NPR’s cultural program "Fresh Air," will present "The Not-So-Great Gatsby: How
Hollywood Misinterprets America’s Greatest Novel" on Monday, Nov. 14.

Both lectures will be held from noon to 1 p.m. in the Mary Pickford Theater on
the third floor of the James Madison Memorial Building, 101 Independence Ave.
S.E., Washington, D.C. Tickets are not required for these events, which are
free and open to the public.

Sponsored by the Library’s Humanities and Social Sciences Division and
Interpretive Programs Office, the lectures are held in conjunction with the
"America Reads" exhibition, which celebrates the public’s choice of 65 books by
American authors that had a profound effect on American life. "America Reads"
is on view in the Library’s Thomas Jefferson Building, 10 First St. S.E.,
Washington, D.C. It is free and open to the public through Dec. 31, 2016,
Monday through Saturday, from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Tickets are not required.

According to Corrigan, film and television directors have produced adaptations
of "The Great Gatsby" for seemingly each generation—from the 1926 silent film
(now lost), to "G," the 2002 hip-hop rendering, and the 2013 opulent version by
Baz Luhrmann. In many critics’ opinions, the results have not always been
great. Illustrated with film clips to compare various versions, Corrigan will
discuss some of the disappointments in adapting Fitzgerald’s novel into film.

Corrigan is a journalist, author and literary critic. She is a
critic-in-residence and lecturer at Georgetown University and a book critic for
NPR’s Peabody Award-winning program "Fresh Air." Her reviews and essays have
been published by The Washington Post, NPR, The Atlantic, The New York Times
and The Boston Globe. Her latest book is "So We Read On: How ‘The Great Gatsby’
Came to Be and Why it Endures."
