excerpt: >
  The El Niño of 2015 - 2016 has been called a Mega Niño or a
  Super El Niño, the strongest since 1997. El Niño occurs every
  two to seven years and its effects are felt the world over.
  Drought-stricken California has had heavy rains and snow,
  while strong storms have caused floods and fueled tornadoes
  elsewhere in the country. Other regions of the world, such as
  Indonesia, have experienced drought and fires.

The El Niño of 2015 - 2016 has been called a Mega Niño or a
Super El Niño, the strongest since 1997. El Niño occurs every
two to seven years and its effects are felt the world over.
Drought-stricken California has had heavy rains and snow,
while strong storms have caused floods and fueled tornadoes
elsewhere in the country. Other regions of the world, such as
Indonesia, have experienced drought and fires.

On Wednesday, March 23, Steven Pawson, an atmospheric scientist and
the chief of the Global Modeling and Assimilation Office at NASA’s
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, will present a
lecture called “El Niño: A NASA Perspective” in the Pickford Theater
on the third floor of the Library’s Madison building, from 11:30 a.m.
to 12:30 p.m. His presentation will cover the broad characteristics
of El Niño, followed by a detailed view of the 2015 - 2016 event and
description of how scientists use computer models to build up a
three-dimensional picture of El Niño in the oceans and atmosphere,
as well as how NASA uses space-based observations to form a more
complete picture of the impact of El Niño on the global earth system.
