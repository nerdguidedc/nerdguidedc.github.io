On the weekend of March 18 - 20, the [Friends of the Arlington
Planetarium](http://friendsoftheplanetarium.org/) will be
holding a mini-film festival, quiz night
and a panel discussion. Sunday we will be having a hands on
activity building hexaflexagons as well as a full-dome show.

We live in a golden age of independent science fiction
filmmaking. Come see a few short examples of the creativity
and imagination of today's filmmakers, including the Arlington
premiere of two short full-dome films by artist Diana Reichenbach!
Friday, March 18, 7:30 pm. Doors open at 7:00 pm.

Come test your science fiction knowledge in a fun evening of
trivia and silly prizes! The quiz will again be administered
by our very own mad scientist 'Doktor Sinister'. Want to show
off your own costuming skills? Science Fiction themed costumes
are welcome - but not required! Small prizes for trivia 
will be awarded. Saturday, March 19, 7pm. Doors open at 6:30 pm.
