Launched on July 16, WOWD-LP (aka Takoma Radio) is sharing Driveway Moments for
the first time. WOWD is DC’s latest low-power FM station, broadcasting at 94.3
FM and streaming at TakomaRadio.org

In March 2015, Historic Takoma announced that its project, Takoma Radio, would
move forward as WOWD-LP, broadcasting in a 2-5 mile radius of Takoma Park. The
town has a unique and vibrant community that craves a real-time voice. The
coverage area is a multi-jurisdictional international crossroads, including
neighborhoods in NE and NW DC, as well as Montgomery and Prince George’s County,
Maryland. Takoma Radio provides a hyper-local FM radio alternative to tens of
thousands of listeners.

This evening will present news about the station’s progress and how to get
involved. The event is free and open to the public but [registration is
required](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/hear-now-takoma-radio-takes-to-the-air-tickets-26589464805).
