The public is invited to a free talk called "The Science of Interstellar:
Life on Planets Around Black Holes” with Dr. Jeremy Schnittman in the
[Pickford Theater](http://www.loc.gov/visit/maps-and-floor-plans/pickford-theater/?loclr=blogadm).

Jeremy Schnittman is a research astrophysicist at [NASA's Goddard Space
Flight Center](http://www.nasa.gov/goddard) in Greenbelt, Maryland. His research interests include
theoretical and computational modeling of black hole accretion flows,
X-ray polarimetry, black hole binaries, gravitational wave sources,
gravitational microlensing, planetary dynamics, resonance dynamics,
and exoplanet atmospheres.

"One of the great things about studying black holes is that you are
constantly pushing your imagination and intuition to the limit,"
Schnittman said. "The same is true about good science fiction movies
like Interstellar: by stretching our imaginations, we can better
understand how black holes behave in the real world."

The presentation will address the "habitability zone" around
supermassive black holes and will discuss the Hollywood movie in
light of the physics governing accretion, relativity, and astrobiology.

The lecture will be later broadcast on the library’s [webcast
page](http://www.loc.gov/today/cyberlc/results.php?cat=8&loclr=blogadm)
and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7D437230CAAB6B9C)
“Topics in Science” playlist.
