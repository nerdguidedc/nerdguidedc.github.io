excerpt: >
  In the 1800s, affiliation with a political party included actual parties.
  All the cool kids back then would drink and vote.  Barbecue, beer, and
  bonfires fueled massive midnight rallies, all to mobilize young voters
  excited to cast their first ballots. The National Museum of American
  History & BYT are joining forces to bring back these vibes with an
  all-access After Hours event on June 18.
