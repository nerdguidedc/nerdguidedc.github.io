Join us for an evening with award-winning science journalist and NPR science
correspondent Richard Harris. Harris will discuss his latest book "Rigor Mortis:
How Sloppy Science Creates Worthless Cures, Crushes Hope, and Wastes Billions",
reflect on his more than three decades of science reporting, and dive into what
he feels are the most pressing science issues facing the country.

In "Rigor Mortis" Harris brings to light the challenges that face biomedical
research and the damaging impact of the hyper competitive quest for research
funding. He lays bare these urgent issues with vivid anecdotes, including
patients feeling the brunt of these problems. Interviews with some of the
nationâ€™s top biomedical researches reveal new strategies for resolving the
reproducibility crisis.
