Winning may not be everything, but it can help protect the planet. Bring your
competitive spirit to the museum for the second Climate Change Game Night, this
time focused on water.  Along the way you’ll learn from experts as you explore
Arctic ice-melt, conserve marine ecosystems, and test the waters of newly
developed games. It’s serious fun.  

The event is free and open to the public but [advance registration is
recommended](http://go.si.edu/site/Calendar?id=101261&view=Detail).
