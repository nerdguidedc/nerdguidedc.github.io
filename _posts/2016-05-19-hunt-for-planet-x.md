excerpt: >
  The Kuiper Belt, which has Pluto as the largest member, is a region of
  comet-like objects just beyond Neptune. For the past few years we have been
  performing the largest and deepest survey ever attempted to search for
  distant solar system objects. The ongoing search has discovered the object
  with the most distant orbit known in our solar system and several of the
  largest known objects after the major planets. On May 19 Dr. Sheppard will
  discuss the most recent discoveries at the fringe of our solar system.

The Kuiper Belt, which has Pluto as the largest member, is a region of
comet-like objects just beyond Neptune. This belt of objects has an outer edge,
which we are only now able to explore in detail. For the past few years we have
been performing the largest and deepest survey ever attempted to search for
distant solar system objects. The ongoing search has discovered the object with
the most distant orbit known in our solar system and several of the largest
known objects after the major planets.

These extremely distant objects are strangely grouped closely together in
space, which suggests a yet unobserved planet more massive than the Earth is
shepherding them into these similar orbits. Dr. Sheppard will discuss the
most recent discoveries at the fringe of our solar system.

The Broad Branch Road Neighborhood Lectures provide an opportunity to get up
close and personal with Carnegie scientists at our campus in northwest
Washington DC. These lectures begin at 6:30 p.m. and last for approximately one
hour, followed by a brief question and answer period. Doors open to the public
at 6:00 p.m. with light refreshments. The campus is located at the intersection
of Broad Branch Road and 32nd Street in northwest Washington, DC. Parking is
