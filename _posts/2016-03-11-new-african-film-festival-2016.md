AFI Silver is proud to host the [12th annual New African Film Festival](http://silver.afi.com/Browsing/EventsAndExperiences/EventDetails/0000000027),
co-presented by AFI, Africa World Now Project and afrikafé. This year’s
festival showcases the vibrancy of African filmmaking from all
corners of the continent. New this year, AFI Silver hosts an African
Marketplace on Saturday, March 12, presented by Fenton Street Market.
From 1:00 – 7:00 pm, ticketholders can shop local vendors selling
African home goods, clothing, books and art in the atrium lobby.

Some of the films to be screened are:

### Crumbs

Set against the backdrop of spectacular post-apocalyptic Ethiopian
landscapes, the film follows a strange-looking scrap collector, Gagano
(the charismatic Daniel Tadesse). Alternately gripped by daydreams and
constant fears, the diminutive Gagano has had enough of collecting
the priceless crumbs of decayed civilization, including the most
valuable: merchandise from Michael Jackson and Michael Jordan. When a
spaceship that has been hovering high in the sky for years starts
showing signs of activity, Gagano must overcome his fears — as well as
a witch, Santa Claus and second-generation Nazis — to discover things
aren't quite what he thought. Official Selection, 2015 Rotterdam,
BAFICI, Los Angeles and Denver Film Festivals. DIR/SCR/PROD Miguel
Llansó. Ethiopia/Spain/Finland, 2015, color, 68 min, DCP. In Amharic
and Afrikaans with English subtitles. NOT RATED

### They Will Have to Kill Us First

Music is the beating heart of Malian culture. But when Islamic
hardliners took control of northern Mali in 2012, they enforced one of
the harshest interpretations of sharia law in history and banned all
forms of music. Radio stations were destroyed, instruments were burned
and Mali’s musicians faced torture, even death, and were forced into
hiding or exile. But rather than lay down their instruments, the
musicians are fighting back, standing up for their cultural heritage
and identity. With a specially commissioned soundtrack from Mali’s most
exciting artists, a score written by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs’ Nick Zinner,
this documentary leaps headfirst into a tale of courage in the face of
conflict. Official Selection, 2015 SXSW and London Film Festivals.
DIR/SCR/PROD Johanna Schwartz; SCR Andy Morgan; PROD Sarah Mosses,
Kat Amara Korba. UK, 2015, color, 105 min, DCP. In French, Songhay,
English, Bambara and Tamasheq with English subtitles. NOT RATED

### Sembene!

In 1952, Ousmane Sembéne, a dockworker and fifth-grade dropout
from Senegal, began dreaming an impossible dream: to become the
storyteller for a new Africa. This documentary tells the unbelievable
true story of the “father of African cinema,” the self-taught novelist
and filmmaker who fought, against enormous odds, a monumental,
50-year-long battle to give African stories to Africans. The story is
told through the experiences of the man who knew him best, colleague
and biographer Samba Gadjigo, using rare archival footage and more
than 100 hours of exclusive materials. This true-life epic follows an
ordinary man who transforms himself into a fearless spokesperson for
the marginalized, becoming a hero to millions. After a startling fall
from grace, can Sembéne reinvent himself once more? Official Selection,
2015 AFI Fest, Sundance, Cannes and New York Film Festivals.
DIR/SCR/PROD Samba Gadjigo, Jason Silverman. Senegal/U.S., 2015,
color, 82 min, DCP. In English and French with English subtitles.
