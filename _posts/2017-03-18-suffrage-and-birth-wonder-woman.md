excerpt: >
  Wonder Woman debuted in 1941 as an antidote to the hyper-masculinity and
  violence of other comic book characters. William Moulton Marston drew
  inspiration from the women’s suffrage movement of the 1910s to create a new
  type of hero. On March 18, join National Park Service Ranger Heidi and hear
  how Wonder Woman’s bullet-repelling bracelets, tiara, and her existence are
  based on incidents and images from the life of her eccentric creator.
