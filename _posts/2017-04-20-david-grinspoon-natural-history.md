The National Museum of Natural History invites you to attend an evening with
astrobiologist, award-winning science communicator, and prize-winning author,
David Grinspoon. Using a big-picture, planetary perspective, Grinspoon will
describe the transformative role humans have played as he speaks about his new
book Earth in Human Hands.

In a conversation with Kirk Johnson, Sant Director of the National Museum of
Natural History, Grinspoon will suggest that our present moment is not only one
of peril, but also great potential, challenging audiences to awaken to our role
as a force of planetary change and become conscious shapers and caretakers of
Earth.

Earth in Human Hands will be available for purchase and signing after the
program.

The event is free and open to the public but [advance registration is
required](http://go.si.edu/site/Calendar?id=101701&view=Detail&s_src=nerdguide_web_cal_er). Seating is limited.
