[Stories in Art](
http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/calendar/family-activities/stories-in-art.html)
introduces children (ages 4 to 7) to artists through careful
looking, storytelling, and hands-on experimentation. Led by museum educators,
each program includes reading a children’s book, exploring one work of art in
the galleries, and completing a simple, hands-on activity. Each program is
approximately 60 minutes.

These free drop-in programs are designed for individual families, and we cannot
accommodate groups. Space is limited. There is no advance registration;
participation is on a first-come, first-served basis. As a courtesy to the
group, we will only accept sign-in for children in the age ranges listed.

Sign-in for Stories in Art will take place in the West Building Rotunda,
beginning at 10:00 am on Saturdays and Mondays and at 11:00 am on Sundays, and
will continue until all spaces are filled.

**Summer Story Series: Discover Dutch Art**

Would you like to visit the Netherlands this summer? Pack your imagination and
travel to the National Gallery of Art! You’ll visit a windmill, sail the seas,
discover mince pie, and listen to a concert. Participants learn about
landscapes, still life, seascapes, and music by reading children’s books,
looking at 17th-century Dutch art, and making a souvenir to document each
adventure. You will receive a passport to the summer story series and a stamp
for each program attended. If you collect all four stamps at the end of the
summer, you will receive a prize!
