Jocelyn Frank presents highlights from Ireland's HearSay, the new
international, community-integrated, audio arts festival.

The *HearSay International Audio Arts Festival* takes place once a
year in the small Irish town of Kilfinane Co. Limerick (pop. 778).
Radio journalist (and DC local) Jocelyn Frank was among the
invited guests at HearSay in 2015. She'll share audio highlights
from the festival's annual competition and selections from the
interactive elements of the 2015 event.

In its second year, HearSay attracted radio professionals,
sound designers, composers, storytellers and activists from
across 25 countries (and many community residents as well).
The invitational festival features cozy sessions based out of
the public library, local middle school, neighborhood pubs,
hardware store, nun's quarters and the historic church.

This evening will include a discussion focusing on the value of
community and accessibility in promoting best-practices and
international collaboration.

**Jocelyn Frank** is an award-winning radio journalist and podcast
producer. She helped develop and launch the successful
UK-facing BBC Radio 4 program Americana and is currently a
commissioning editor for the public radio series God and
Government, broadcast nationally on Interfaith Voices.
She produces Slate's Political Gabfest on the Panoply podcast network.

Frank is a managing facilitator of the D.C. Listening Lounge
(founded in 2005). In that role she works to curate the annual
Sound Scene interactive audio installation in downtown
Washington DC (since 2007). She helps lead DCLL's monthly
workshops and audio field trips for audio artists and
enthusiasts, journalists and scholars across the Washington D.C. region.

This event is organized in cooperation with Hear Now!, an
informal group of local producers and radiophiles, presents
cutting-edge listening experiences and discussions as well
as a chance to hear whatâ€™s going on in public radio across the
country and around the world.

The event is free and open to the public but [registration is
required](http://www.goethe.de/ins/us/was/ver/en15209272v.htm).
