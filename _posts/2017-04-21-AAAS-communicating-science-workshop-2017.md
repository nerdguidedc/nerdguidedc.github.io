The [AAAS Communicating Science
Workshop](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/aaas-communicating-science-workshop-tickets-33397013366)
is specifically designed to address the needs of scientists and engineers to
communicate scientific or technical information in a variety of public and
professional interactions, such as media interviews, writing grant proposals,
discussing ideas with students, testifying before Congress, or participating in
public forums. Workshop goals include building scientistsâ€™ communication skill
and confidence in engaging with public audiences and providing best practices
for use of different communication methods and mechanisms. The program uses
empirical evidence from research in science communication and public engagement
with science, and maintains an evaluation program that confirms workshops are
meeting defined goals. Through discussion, self-reflection, small group work,
and practice sessions, the workshop will focus on the importance of effective
communication that clearly conveys scientific concepts. We encourage workshop
participants to think about how content applies to their own work and
communication opportunities.
