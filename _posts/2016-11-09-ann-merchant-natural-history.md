The National Museum of Natural History invites you to attend a special evening
with Ann Merchant, Deputy Executive Director for Communications at the National
Academies. Merchant is responsible for The Science & Entertainment Exchange, a
program that connects the entertainment and science communities. If you’ve seen
major films such as Captain America, Divergent, Frozen, and Battleship (to name
a few), you’ve seen the results of Merchant’s work.

In conversation with Kirk Johnson, Sant Director of the National Museum of
Natural History, Merchant will give a first-hand look at how The Exchange is
working to bring more—and better—science to film and television. And, if these
major films are any proof, audiences are hungry for a good dose of
(entertaining) science!

This program is part of the An Evening With... signature series featuring
cutting-edge thought leaders in conversation with paleontologist and Sant
Director of the National Museum of Natural History, Kirk Johnson.

The event is free and open to the public but [advance registration is
required](http://go.si.edu/site/Calendar?id=101365&view=Detail&s_src=nerdguide_web_cal_er). Seating
is limited.
