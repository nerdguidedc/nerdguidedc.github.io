The National Museum of Natural History invites you to attend a special evening
with Deputy Executive Director for Communications at the National Academy of
Sciences, Ann Merchant.

Merchant is responsible for a program called the Science & Entertainment
Exchange, which connects the entertainment and science communities. If you’ve
seen major films such as Captain America, Divergent, Frozen, and Battleship – to
name a few, you’ve seen the results of Merchant’s work.

In conversation with Kirk Johnson, Sant Director of the National Museum of
Natural History, Merchant will give a first-hand look at how The Exchange is
working to bring more – and better – science to film and television. And, if
these major films are any proof, audiences are hungry for a good dose of
(entertaining) science!

The event is free and open to the public but [advance registration is
required](http://go.si.edu/site/Calendar?view=Detail&id=101365). Seating
is limited.
