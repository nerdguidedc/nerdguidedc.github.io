excerpt: >
  When we think viral, cat videos may come to mind first. I mean they are
  everywhere these days. Particularly the one where cats say “Hey” instead of
  “meow”. But cuteness and humor are not the only things contagious and they are
  by far the least dangerous. The Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural
  History is bringing out the experts who work on the more virulent pathogens to
  bring tales of outbreaks, plagues, and the bats that carry them. No hazmat
  suit required for this November’s Nerd Nite on Saturday, November 12, but you
  might just find it infectious!

Nerd Nite is a monthly event held in more than 75 cities across the globe
during which several folks give 18-21-minute fun-yet-informative
presentations across all disciplines – while the audience drinks along.
Despite our similar names the Nerd Guide DC and Nerd Nite DC are
unaffiliated but kindred spirits. Doors open at 6:00, show starts
at 6:30. Tickets are $10. More information available at the [Nerd Nite
DC](https://dc.nerdnite.com) website. This is a 21+ event.

### Opening Pandora's Box: Natural History Goes Viral!

When we think viral, cat videos may come to mind first. I mean they are
everywhere these days. Particularly the one where cats say “Hey” instead of
"meow". But cuteness and humor are not the only things contagious and they are
by far the least dangerous. The Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History
is bringing out the experts who work on the more virulent pathogens to bring
tales of outbreaks, plagues, and the bats that carry them. No hazmat suit
required for this November’s Nerd Nite, but you might just find it infectious!

**Solving Today’s Plagues by Digging into the Past**

Sabrina Sholts

Many visitors grace the halls of The National Museum of Natural History and
marvel in awe. Yet most of the life-changing specimens are hidden behind the
scenes, in the vast collections and with the scientists who curate them. From
anthropology to zoology, collections can hold keys critical for research on
major global threats including infectious disease. Curators are digging into the
past to understand the new and not-so-new greatest threats to humanity (epidemic
style) and produce knowledge that creates our shield against them.

Bio: Sabrina Sholts is a curator of physical anthropology at the Smithsonian's
National Museum of Natural History and she spends most of her time focusing on
the sniffles that plagued those who lived far in the past. Her research will be
coming to the floor soon in the new exhibition entitled "Outbreak-- Epidemics in
a Connected World".

**Guano Happens: (Mis)Adventures of a Bat Biologist**

Megan Vodzak

Bats are extraordinary animals. They are ridiculously diverse (making up 20% of
mammalian species), widespread (found on every continent except Antarctica), and
are the only mammal capable of true flight (you’re learning already!). Without
bats, we’d have lots more pests and lots less tequila. These winged creatures
are ecologically critical, yet pose a significant threat in their ability to
harbor some pretty gnarly pathogens that can lead to deadly human and animal
disease. Step into the fascinating world of bats, their pathogens, and what it
takes to study them!

Bio: Megan Vodzak is a public health maven and bat researcher who has stepped in
guano on multiple continents while contributing to the advancement of human
knowledge. Wandering through tropical regions throughout the globe, she’s
investigated the biology and infectious diseases of bats for nine years. She’s
the current reigning champion of Competitive Infectious Virology at Smithsonian
Global Health, a dubious honor that has earned her more beverages than fame.

**Preventing the Zombie Apocalypse**

Kali Holder

Human expansion around the globe is leading to increased contact with wildlife
and declines in environmental health on unprecedented scales. These disastrous
changes are exposing human and animal populations to novel pathogens through new
and exciting transmission pathways. As multiple bestsellers and blockbusters
have noted, this sets the world up for some potentially concerning outcomes
ranging from undead hordes to ape overlords. Let’s talk about the science of
bio-catastrophe prevention, otherwise known as One Health.

Bio: Kali Holder is a veterinary pathologist working for Smithsonian Global
Health where she diligently combats potential pandemics and threats to
endangered species. With her diverse knowledge of terrible diseases throughout
the animal kingdom and cheerfully morbid imagination, she is the only known
human who can win a game of Worst Case Scenario against WebMD.
