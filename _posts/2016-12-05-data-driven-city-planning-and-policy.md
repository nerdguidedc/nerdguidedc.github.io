City and local governments must make complex policy and planning decisions while
simultaneously facing pressure to become more economically efficient,
environmentally friendly, and socially responsive. The abundance of data
generated and collected by cities has tremendous potential to ground these
decisions in empirical evidence; however, practical, institutional, and
methodological challenges make widespread adoption of data-driven governance
difficult. We invite you to join the Committee on Applied and Theoretical
Statistics of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine for
a panel discussion featuring innovative research and critical challenges in data
driven policy and planning for cities.

The event is free and open to the public but [advance registration
required](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/data-driven-city-planning-policy-registration-29031961378)
to attend either in-person or watch the live webcast.
