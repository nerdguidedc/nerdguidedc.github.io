The National Cherry Blossom Festival is kicking off kite season and
celebrating 50 years of kite flying on the National Mall! Carrying
the legacy of the Smithsonian Kite Festival which first took place

creativity of kite makers and skill of fliers from across the US and
other countries through a variety of competitions and demonstrations.
Bring your own kites or children can make a kite at an activity
station (while supplies last) to fly on the Public Field.

Please note: drones are prohibited at this event.

The Rain date is Sunday, April 3, 2016 at 12 PM.
