Prix Europa, held every fall in Berlin's historic Haus des Rundfunks
(Broadcasting House) is the prestigious annual competition that brings together
the best of European radio, television, and multi-media productions. Producers
and broadcasters submit their best work of the previous year. The prize-winners
are selected by juries consisting of the peers of those who are entering the
competition – each juror agrees to listen to (or watch) and score all entries in
a given category. Radio Berlin-Brandenburg, the public broadcaster, hosts the
competition. For the last several years, "Hear Now" has presented excerpts of
the best European radio productions – with scripts provided in the original
language and in English translations, following the example of Prix Europa
itself. This evening will feature excerpts from four pieces presented at
Berlin's Prix Europa 2015 Competition.

**Junkies in the Country (Poudreuse dans la Meuse)**  
Radio Documentary by Mehdi Ahoudig for ARTE Radio (France), 39 minutes

The département (district) of the Meuse in northeastern France holds the
national record for heroin consumption. With Maastricht in the Netherlands three
hours' drive away, heroin is ravaging the countryside and the kids hanging out
in bus shelters and around fountains. Linda, Gaelle and Sabbia are three young
mothers who got hooked on heroin in their home village. Today, they are
struggling with an addiction that has taken over their lives. Law enforcement,
judiciary and medics explain the ins-and-outs of drug-taking in a rural district
totally unprepared for this wave of junkies.

**The Emergence of Terror - A Feature About the Escalation of Violence (Wie Terror entsteht - Ein Feature über die Eskalation von Gewalt)**  
Radio Current Affairs by Johanna Braun for WDR Radio (Germany), 53 minutes

Hundreds of people have been killed and injured in Kenya from terror attacks
during the past few months. The Kenyan anti-terror police unit (ATPU) is dealing
very harshly with any suspects. Human rights groups are accusing them of killing
and getting rid of Muslims which the Kenyan government constantly denies. The
Kenyan police are supported with training programs and materials from Germany.
For a long time Kenya has been an important economic and political partner for
the West, and lately an ally in the international fight against terror. Kenya is
a front-line state in this battle, as it borders Somalia where the Islamist
Al-Shabaab militants, who belong to Al Qaeda, are active. Al-Shabaab have
carried out brutal attacks in Kenya and were responsible for the bloodbath at
the University of Garissa in April 2015, where 148 people died.

Following intensive research, the author has gained an insight into the brutal
reality of the Kenyan war against terror. A leading member of the ATPU tells her
that the security forces are advised to take ‘no prisoners’ – just kill any
suspects. This massive governmental force as a reaction to the terror is driving
Kenyan Muslims into the arms of the Islamic militia. The fear of attacks is
keeping tourists away. The people of Kenya are losing their work and poverty is
spreading, making people more susceptible to radicalization by Al-Shabaab, who
promise money in exchange for terror attacks. A vicious circle.

**Boswell's Lives: Boswell's Life of Freud**  
Radio Fiction Series by the BBC

Boswell's Lives is a new comedy series from the BBC in which James Boswell, Dr.
Johnson's celebrated biographer, pursues other legends to immortalize. In
Episode One, he attempted to write a biography of Sigmund Freud but finds it is
Freud who is asking all the questions. In the following episodes Boswell met
Maria Callas, Harold Pinter and Boris Johnson. The series is now in its second
season; we will present one of the programs.

**The Voices of Elly Stone**  
Radio Music Program produced by BBC4 and Alan Hall of Falling Tree Productions

Elly Stone is a modest 87-year-old New Yorker ("born and dragged up"), whose
sublime voice will forever be associated with the songs of Belgian chanteur
Jacques Brel. In My Childhood, Song for Old Lovers, The Old Folks and Carousel,
she brings a new perspective to Brel's familiar emotional intensity and piercing
social commentary. Twenty years after her retirement from the stage, she offers
a rare insight into her life and what music has meant to her - in a quiet New
York studio, out on the streets of her bustling city and at Sardi's, the famous
theater restaurant. Running through Elly's own story - from troubled childhood,
through Broadway success, to marriage, motherhood and mid-life epiphany -
there's a musical counterpoint that can be traced in the songs she famously made
her own in the musical revue Jacques Brel's Alive and Well and Living in Paris.

The event is free and open to the public but [registration is
