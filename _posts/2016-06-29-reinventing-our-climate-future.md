Innovation is an essential component to meet the challenges of climate change.
Better ways to produce, store, conserve, and transmit energy will help the U.S.
and other nations meet the ambitious goals set at the United Nations climate
change conference held in Paris in December 2015.

Join the Director of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, Michelle K. Lee, and
a panel of technology, energy, and climate experts for a discussion on how
present and future innovation can change the course of our planet’s future.

Questions to explore will include:

* What do we need do more, do differently, do faster, to change course and evolve our energy system to be clean, efficient, accessible, dependable and low-carbon?
* Where do we need breakthroughs in technology to really make a difference?
* What policies would help drive the innovation we need?
* What business model innovation is needed?

The event is free and open to the public but [registration is required](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/innovation-to-power-the-nation-and-the-world-reinventing-our-climate-future-tickets-25736843592?aff=ebrowse).
