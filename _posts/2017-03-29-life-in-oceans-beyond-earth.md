Where is the best place to find living life beyond Earth? It may be that the
small, ice-covered moons of Jupiter and Saturn harbor some of the most habitable
real estate in our Solar System. Life loves liquid water and these moons have
lots of it!

Dr. Kevin Hand will explain the science behind why we think we know these oceans
exist and what we know about the conditions on these worlds. He will focus on
Jupiter’s moon Europa, which is a top priority for future NASA missions. Dr.
Hand will also show how the exploration of Earth’s ocean is helping to inform
our understanding of the potential habitability of worlds like Europa. Dr. Hand
was a scientist onboard James Cameron’s 2012 dive to the bottom of the Mariana
Trench, and he was part of a 2003 IMAX expedition to hydrothermal vents in the
Atlantic and Pacific oceans. He has made nine dives to the bottom of the ocean.

The talk is part of Space Science Week 2017—a three-day gathering of the Space
Studies Board and Board on Physics and Astronomy to discuss issues and advances
in their fields. Inquiries may be directed to spaceweek@nas.edu.

***Dr. Kevin P. Hand*** is Deputy Chief Scientist for Solar System Exploration
at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. His research
focuses on the origin, evolution, and distribution of life in the solar system
with an emphasis on Jupiter’s moon, Europa. His work involves both theoretical
and laboratory research on the physics and chemistry of icy moons in the outer
solar system. His work has brought him to the Dry Valleys of Antarctica, the
depths of the Earth’s oceans, and to the glaciers of Kilimanjaro. In 2011 he was
selected as a National Geographic Emerging Explorer. Hand earned his PhD from
Stanford University and bachelors degrees from Dartmouth College. He was born
and raised in Manchester, Vermont.

The Annual Sackler Public Lecture is free and open to the public, however
