When a new airplane comes off the production line at Boeing, someone has to be
the first to fly it. That’s where [Suzanna
Darcy-Hennemann](http://stuckattheairport.com/2014/03/30/trailblazing-women-of-boeing/), Boeing’s first female test pilot, shines. As the retired Chief Pilot,
Flight Services for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, Darcy-Hennemann was involved
in the 777 program since its inception and contributed to the design, testing,
and certification of the initial airplane and its derivatives. Darcy-Hennemann
is rated as a captain on the 747-400, 737, 757, and 767, and holds several
distance and speed records on Boeing aircraft.

Join us for this lecture to hear about how airplanes are certified, view Flight
Test Footage, and learn why, when flight testing, test pilots should never wear
pearls. This world record-holder for distance flown by a commercial aircraft
will also tell you about her team’s record-breaking 21,601.33 km (13,422.44
miles) non-stop flight from Hong Kong to London aboard a Boeing 777-200LR
Worldliner.

The event is free and open to the public but [advance
