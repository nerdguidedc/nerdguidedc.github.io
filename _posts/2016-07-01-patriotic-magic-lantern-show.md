An authentic 1890s magic-lantern show, at the Library of Congress on July 1,
will transport visitors to the time of Jacob Riis, the crusading
turn-of-the-20th-century journalist and photographer.

"The Patriotic Magic-Lantern Show" will take place from 11 a.m. to noon on
Friday, July 1, in the Coolidge Auditorium on the ground level of the Thomas
Jefferson Building, 10 First St. S.E., Washington, D.C. The performance is free
and open to the public. Tickets are not needed, but seating is limited on a
first-come, first-served basis. Doors will open 30 minutes before show time.
Children 12 years old and younger must be accompanied by an adult.

The family-friendly program is not a magic show, but a magic-lantern show, a
visual extravaganza projected on a full-sized screen—a forerunner to movies. The
show will depict America’s history, dramatized in stories, comedy and songs by a
combination of projected pictures, a live showman and a singer/pianist. The
audience participates with chants, cheers and singing.

The magic-lantern show is being held in conjunction with the exhibition "Jacob
Riis: Revealing 'How the Other Half Lives,'" a co-presentation of the Library of
Congress and the Museum of the City of New York. The exhibition is free and open
to the public through Sept. 5, 2016, in the South Gallery of the Jefferson
Building. The work of Riis, whose stories and photographs of the squalid
conditions in New York City’s tenements led to important social reforms, is
explored in the exhibition. For an online version, visit

Riis himself was a well-known magic-lantern lecturer who traveled across the
country with his box of lantern slides to inform Americans about urban poverty
and the need for social reform. He presented the lectures to enthusiastic crowds
as a supplement to his articles and books. In some of his lectures, Riis
addressed the theme of patriotism.

The exhibition's curator Barbara Bair said, "In his 1892 book "Children of the
Poor" and his related lantern-slide shows, Jacob Riis portrayed immigrant school
children of many ethnicities who joined together to salute the American flag as
participating in a powerfully symbolic patriotic act, heralding a revitalized
republic. He praised civics education as crucial in the making of a new
generation of naturalized citizens, in whom would rest the promise of the
American society of the future."

The American Magic-Lantern Theater—the nation's only theater company that
re-creates the Victorian magic-lantern shows—will present the program, which is
co-sponsored by the the Library's Interpretive Programs Office, Educational
Outreach Division and Visitor Services Office. The show will feature lead
performer Terry Borton, a fourth-generation lanternist, and Nancy Stewart, a
pianist and soprano. The American Magic-Lantern Theater uses original antique
projection equipment.
