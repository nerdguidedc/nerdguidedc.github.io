Explore the ocean through our hands-on science program this summer at Koshland.
Each session focuses on a different aspect of the ocean – everything from ocean
engineering to ocean-related STEM careers. Students can build a water filter,
discover the effects of ocean acidification on bivalves, design a reusable lunch
bag, and much more! Koshland's hands-on science program is sure to keep your
STEM students engaged in science all summer long.

The event is free and open to the public. [Registration is
recommended](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/summer-hands-on-science-ocean-exploration-tickets-25996765024).
