Join the National Archives and Records Administration and the Law Library of
Congress for the first in a series of a workshop and an edit-a-thon focused on
improving Wikipedia entries related to proposed Constitutional amendments based
on National Archives and Law Library of Congress records. Activities included
new editor orientation and training and a presentation from National Archives
staff. Coffee and lunch will be generously provided courtesy of Wikimedia D.C..
This event is part of the Amending America initiative at the National
Archives in commemoration of the 225th anniversary of the Bill of Rights.

Bring a Photo ID and a laptop. Limited number of loaner laptops will be
available. To access NARA's Innovation Hub, please use the National Archives
Building's entrance at Pennsylvania Avenue. This is the research/staff entrance,
not the main exhibits/events door.

The event is free and open to the public but [registration is recommended](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Meetup/DC/ProposedAmendments).
