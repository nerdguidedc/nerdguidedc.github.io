This discovery, which earned a Nobel prize, led to dramatic advances in understanding infectious disease, evolution, and the controls that turn genes on and off in specific places and tissues. This talk on March 16 will discuss early life on Earth, how jumping genes may have influenced it, and why we should care about jumping genes now... for example if you use antibiotics.

Since 1991, the Carnegie Institution has hosted extraordinary
researchers from a wide range of scientific disciplines as part
of the Capital Science Evenings lecture series. The lectures
provide a unique opportunity to connect with some of the most
gifted investigators in science and hear the stories behind
their discoveries.

All lectures are free and open to the public, and begin at 6:30 PM
at the Carnegie Institute for Science. Doors open at 6:00.
These hour-long lectures, followed by a brief
question and answer period, go beyond the media accounts for a
firsthand look at the “ah-ha” moments, the setbacks, and the triumphs
that drive brilliant minds and fundamentally change our understanding
of the world around us.

Registration is required. You can [register online](https://carnegiescience.edu/events/lectures/jumping-genes-what-they-mean-evolution-and-medicine).

#### Jumping Genes: What They Mean For Evolution and Medicine

The DNA of one human cell—two copies of our “genome”—would stretch almost two
meters if fully extended. However, normally it’s tightly packaged in 46
chromosomes. About 20,000 genes are distributed along this DNA; they carry the
information for building and operating a human. Any particular gene is located
at a specific place in a chromosome and, normally, stays there. Carnegie
scientist Barbara McClintock discovered, in corn, that some genes jump from one
place in a chromosome to another. Similar things occur in most organisms,
including us. This discovery, which earned a Nobel prize, led to dramatic
advances in understanding infectious disease, evolution, and the controls that
turn genes on and off in specific places and tissues. This talk will discuss
early life on Earth, how jumping genes may have influenced it, and why we should
care about jumping genes now... for example if you use antibiotics.
