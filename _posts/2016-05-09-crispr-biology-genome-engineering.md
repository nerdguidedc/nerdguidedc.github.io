excerpt: >
  On May 9, CRISPR pioneer Jennifer Doudna presents a brief history of CRISPR
  biology from its initial discovery through the elucidation of the
  CRISPR-Cas9 enzyme mechanism, providing the foundation for remarkable
  developments using this technology to modify, regulate, or visualize
  genomic loci in a wide variety of cells and organisms.

The genome editing system called CRISPR earned Science magazine's
"2015 Breakthrough of the Year." The advent of facile genome engineering
using the bacterial RNA-guided CRISPR-Cas9 system in animals and plants is
transforming biology. In this talk, CRISPR pioneer Jennifer Doudna presents
a brief history of CRISPR biology from its initial discovery through the
elucidation of the CRISPR-Cas9 enzyme mechanism, providing the foundation
for remarkable developments using this technology to modify, regulate, or
visualize genomic loci in a wide variety of cells and organisms. These results
highlight a new era in which genomic manipulation is no longer a bottleneck
to experiments, paving the way to both fundamental discoveries in biology,
with applications in all branches of biotechnology, and strategies for
human therapeutics. Recent results regarding the molecular mechanism of Cas9
and its use for targeted cell-based therapies will be discussed.
