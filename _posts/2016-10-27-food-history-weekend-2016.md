Join us in the fall of 2016, as Smithsonian’s National Museum of American
History brings together culinary leaders, researchers, practitioners, and
scholars to inspire Museum visitors to understand the history of food in
America and the role they play, individually and collectively, in shaping the
future of food.

Through live cooking demonstrations, hands-on learning opportunities, talks,
experiences with incomparable collections, and much more, the [2016 Smithsonian
Food History Weekend](http://americanhistory.si.edu/events/food-history-weekend)
will explore the relationship between food, politics, and
people. How have we participated, as individuals and communities, in shaping
American food and foodways? Whose voices are influencing food policy today?
What are the critical issues, and what role does democracy play in the future
of food in America?

Celebrate food history with us through five unique events over the course of
three days:
