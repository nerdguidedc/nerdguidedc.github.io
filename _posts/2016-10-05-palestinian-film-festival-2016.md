The [DC Palestinian Film and Arts Festival](http://www.dcpfaf.org/) champions
the work of Palestinian artists and filmmakers in Palestine and in diaspora,
showcasing the range and complexity of Palestinian identities and narratives.

Some of the films to be screened are:

### Ave Maria

The silent routine of 5 Palestinian nuns in the middle of the west bank
wilderness is disrupted when a family of Israeli settlers come knocking at
their door for help after crashing into the convent’s wall. The Israelis can’t
operate a phone to call for assistance due to the sabbath laws, and the nuns
have taken a vow of silence. Together they have to come up with an unorthodox
plan to help them get home.

### Junction 48

Kareem leads an aimless life between odd jobs and hanging out with his buddies
in a crime-ridden Arab ghetto of the mixed city of Lyd. A family tragedy brings
him closer to his singer girlfriend, Manar, and motivates him to do something
more with his life. When Kareem and his group finally get a chance to perform in
a Tel Aviv hip-hop club, the star potential of the 'first Arab rapper' is
quickly noticed. Although he raps "I'm not political," Kareem and the group use
music to express their tough life as Palestinian youth. But the road to success
is never easy... Kareem and his group must face violent nationalistic Jewish
rappers, government-imposed gentrification and troubled drug-dealing friends.
When Manar's family threatens to harm them if she performs publicly with him,
the time comes for Kareem to either surrender to conservative tradition or stand
up for the woman he loves, the artist he respects...

### Home Sweet Home

One day, on the telephone between Beirut and Paris, my mother tells me: Your
father has serious money problems, he has no choice, he has to sell his school,
the banks have no scruples. I hear the loss and feel unsteady.

I have always been the headmaster's daughter of the school La Colline Libanaise
and I cannot imagine it any other way. I decide to go home.
