The Center for the Book in the Library of Congress and its Young Readers
Center will sponsor two events to mark the 150th anniversary of the
Lewis Carroll classic "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland."

On Friday, April 8, at 10:30 AM, the Young Readers Center hosts a
special "dress-up" story time featuring Carroll's classic. All costumed
children will be invited to join an "Alice parade" on the first two
floors of the Thomas Jefferson Building. Inside the Young Readers Center,
a display of several versions of the book, games and other artifacts
will be on view during April. The center is located on the ground floor
of the Thomas Jefferson Building, Room G29.

On Friday, April 15, at noon, the Center for the Book will present
historian Leonard Marcus in a wide-ranging illustrated talk,
"Lewis Carroll in the Mirror of Surrealism." Marcus will show how
Carroll's "Alice" not only turned Victorian literature on its head
but also inspired later generations of experimental artists and writers,
from Andre Breton and Max Ernst to Rene Magritte and Leonora Carrington,
to reimagine the world in arrestingly strange and provocative new ways.
Part of the center's Books & Beyond author series, the event will be
held in Room LJ 119 of the Jefferson Building.

Both events are free and open to the public; no tickets are required.
