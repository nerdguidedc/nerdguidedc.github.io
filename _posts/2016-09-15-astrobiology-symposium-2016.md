"The Emergence of Life: On the Earth, in the Lab and Elsewhere" will be hosted
by Nathaniel Comfort, the current NASA/Library of Congress Chair in
Astrobiology at the Library’s John W. Kluge Center. The symposium will be held
in room 119 on the first floor of the Library’s Thomas Jefferson Building. The
event is free and open to the public. Tickets are not needed.

The Kluge Center is presenting the symposium, as part of its joint NASA/Library
of Congress Astrobiology Program.

Scientists, scholars and journalists will participate in the panels, including:

* Nsikan Akpan, science writer and producer, PBS News Hour
* Steven Benner, synthetic biologist, Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution
* Jim Cleaves, chemist, Geophysical Laboratory, Carnegie Institute
* Bill Mesler, independent science writer
* Sophia Roosth, historian of science, Harvard University
* Matt Schrenk, geomicrobiologist, Michigan State University
* Carl Zimmer, award-winning science writer, New York Times

The event also will feature the incoming NASA/Library of Congress Chair in
Astrobiology for 2016-2017, historian of science Luis Campos, and two previous
chair holders: planetary scientist David Grinspoon; and historian and
astronomer Steven Dick. For a schedule and further information, visit

Comfort is a historian of recent science and a professor at the Institute of
the History of Medicine at The Johns Hopkins University. His books include "The
Science of Human Perfection: How Genes Became the Heart of American Medicine"
(2012) and "The Tangled Field: Barbara McClintock’s Search for the Patterns of
Genetic Control" (2001).
