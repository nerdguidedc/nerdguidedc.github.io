Washington, DC, offers a rich commemorative landscape filled with monuments that
evoke a sense of national heritage and identity. But how might we develop and
experience the next century’s memorials, telling more of America’s stories?
An expert panel moderated by Jason Schupbach, director of design
programs at the National Endowment for the Arts, discusses these topics and the
relationship of commemoration to memory, identity, and place-making in the
nation’s capital. Panelists include Edward T. Linenthal, history professor at
the University of Indiana; Brent Leggs, a preservation division senior field
officer with the National Trust for Historic Preservation, and artist Janet
Echelman. Before the discussion, David van der Leer, executive director of Van
Alen Institute, will announce the three finalist teams for the Memorials for the
Future ideas competition. Presented in partnership with the National Capital
Planning Commission, the National Park Service, and the Van Alen Institute.
