excerpt: >
  An electronic current is made up of the flow of electrons. As engineers shrink
  electrical transistors down to nanoscale dimensions, electrons get trapped,
  making it difficult for digital computers to work as well as they should. In
  contrast, our brains have nano-sized channels through which tiny charged
  particles pass freely when they are opened. Dr. Boahen’s team creates computer
  technology that mimics the way our brains are wired. The evening of June 22 at
  the Carnegie Institute for Science.

Since 1991, the Carnegie Institution has hosted extraordinary
researchers from a wide range of scientific disciplines as part
of the Capital Science Evenings lecture series. The lectures
provide a unique opportunity to connect with some of the most
gifted investigators in science and hear the stories behind
their discoveries.

All lectures are free and open to the public, and begin at 6:30 PM
at the Carnegie Institute for Science.
These hour-long lectures, followed by a brief
question and answer period, go beyond the media accounts for a
firsthand look at the “ah-ha” moments, the setbacks, and the triumphs
that drive brilliant minds and fundamentally change our understanding
of the world around us.

Registration is required. You can [register online](https://carnegiescience.edu/events/lectures/dr-kwabena-boahen-neuromorphic-computing).
