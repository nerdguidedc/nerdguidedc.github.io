This talk examines the pivotal role played by the blockbuster
*Das Boot* (1981) in establishing a new production model and
aesthetic vision for German film. Ushering in a shift away from
the director-driven New German Cinema of the 1960s and 1970s and
toward a new commercially oriented genre cinema, *Das Boot* made a
virtue of the financial limitations of German film production in
the 1980s and established new strategies for appealing to global
audiences that continue to hold sway in the twenty-first century.
Focusing on the film's formal and technological innovations as well
as its double-edged politics, this talk presents a critical take
on what remains — even thirty-five years after its initial
release — the most commercially successful foreign-language
film ever released in North America.
