When we think of Venice, we think of a city in the sea, a city surrounded by
water. And yet, before the modern era, the city had no source of fresh water
other than the rain from heaven or barges from the mainland. Therein lies the
paradox: Venice is in the water and has no water. This lecture addresses how the
Venetians dealt with this deficiency of nature by creating a unique genre of
public art: the Venetian wellhead. Also addressed are the change and the
challenge that came with the expansion of the Venetian empire: the gift of
running water and the need to harness it. Again, the Venetians seized the
initiative and created fountains that transformed urban spaces from the
Terraferma to the Stato da Mar into places of encounter and aesthetic delight.

Patricia Fortini Brown is professor emerita at Princeton University, where she
taught in the department of art and archaeology (1983 – 2010) and served as
chair (1999 – 2005). Brown was Slade Professor of Fine Arts at the University of
Cambridge and served as president of the Renaissance Society of America. A
recipient of the British Academy Serena Medal in Italian Studies, she has held a
number of prestigious fellowships including a Guggenheim Fellowship and the Rome
Prize and presently serves on the Board of Directors of Save Venice. Brown has
published and lectured extensively on the art and history of late medieval and
early modern Venice and is presently focusing on its colonial empire. Her
award-winning books include Venetian Narrative Painting in the Age of Carpaccio
(1988); Venice and Antiquity: The Venetian Sense of the Past (1996); Art and
Life in Renaissance Venice (1997); and Private Lives in Renaissance Venice: Art,
Architecture, and the Family (2004). She is now working on a book entitled The
Venetian Bride, a true story of vendetta and intrigue, exile and redemption.

The Sydney J. Freedberg Lecture on Italian Art features distinguished scholars
present­ing original research. This annual lecture series offered by the
National Gallery of Art began in 1997 and is named after the great specialist of
Italian art Sydney J. Freedberg (1914–1997). Professor Freedberg earned his PhD
from Harvard University in 1940, where he taught for 29 years until he was
appointed chief curator of the National Gallery of Art in 1983.
