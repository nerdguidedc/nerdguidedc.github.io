  The Obon at Ekoji Buddhist Temple is the only Obon in the Washington DC
  region. Obon combines joyous activities such as dancing, drumming and great
  food with solemn aspects such as lighting a candle in memory of one’s
  ancestors. Everyone is welcome to light a candle and have a quiet moment in
  the peaceful garden. It’s a perfect summer evening filled with unforgettable
  moments. Saturday July 9 from 5:00 to 9:00 PM.

The [Obon Festival](http://ekojiobonfestival.weebly.com/) is an annual summer
event that is an opportunity to celebrate our loved ones and those that have
come before us. Come join us for some great food, traditional Japanese folk
dancing, kids games, live Hawaiian music by the Aloha Boys, Japanese taiko
drumming by Nen Daiko, temple tours, and our evening candle ceremony where we
remember and thank those who have come before us.

Ekoji Buddhist Temple would like to thank the Fairfax Baptist Temple for
allowing Obon participants to park in their parking lot. The Fairfax Baptist
Temple is located just a few blocks down the road from Ekoji at 6401 Missionary
Lane. Police officers will be on hand to direct drivers and ensure people safely
cross Burke Lake Road when arriving at Obon.
