Writer and historian Warren Bernard will discuss and sign his new book,
“Cartoons for Victory” (Fantagraphics Books, 2015). The event is co-sponsored
with the Prints and Photographs Division.

The years 1939-1945 were a time not only of war but also of great social
upheaval. With many men on the battle lines, women were left to work the
assembly lines. African-Americans were fighting alongside their white
counterparts before discrimination was officially ended. Superman, Donald Duck,
Mickey Mouse and other characters helped fight World War II via comic books and
strips, single-panel and editorial cartoons and even ads. More than 90 percent
of the cartoons and comics in this book have not been seen since their first
publication.

Warren Bernard is co-author of the Eisner-nominated “Drawing Power” and the
executive director of Small Press Expo. He has lectured on comics at the Library
of Congress and the Center for Cartoon Studies.

The event is free and open to the public; registration is not required.
