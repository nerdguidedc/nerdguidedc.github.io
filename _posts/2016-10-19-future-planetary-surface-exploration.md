Did you ever wonder what equipment a rock hound in space would bring along? On
October 19, planetary geologist Dr. Kelsey Young will present “The Future of
Planetary Surface Exploration,” where she will highlight the development of
portable tools and technology that will accompany future astronauts. Dr. Young
is a research scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center whose research
interests include using sites on Earth as testing grounds for advancing
planetary field geology and developing the technology needed to carry out
geologic and geochemical observations on other planetary surfaces, whether on
the Moon, Mars or asteroids. She served as a geologist crewmember for the 2010
Desert RATS mission, living in the Space Exploration Rover for one week with
astronaut Stephanie Wilson.

This event is free and open to the public. No registration is required.
