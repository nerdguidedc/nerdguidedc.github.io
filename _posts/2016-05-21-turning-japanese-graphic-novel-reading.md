To celebrate Asian American Heritage month, Eisner-nominated (Comic Con 2015)
[MariNaomi will be reading](http://www.bigplanetcomics.com/marinaomi-signing)
from her new graphic novel "Turning Japanese" and signing book copies.
Similar to Marjane Satrapi's "Persepolis," Mari chronicles her cultural
coming-of-age story with humor, insight and nuance. As a mixed race
Japanese-American who grew up in a white suburb of San Francisco, Mari set out
to learn Japanese by working in an illegal Japanese hostess bar in San Jose, CA.
Her goal was to connect with her culture and learn the language so she could
visit Japan and communicate with relatives without the filter of her mother. It
is a story of culture clash, generation gaps, connection and otherness.
MariNaomi is the writer and artist of Kiss & Tell: A Romantic Resume,
Ages 0 to 22 and Dragonâ€™s Breath and Other True Stories.
