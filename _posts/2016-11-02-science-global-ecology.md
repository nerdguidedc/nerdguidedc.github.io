Since 1991, the Carnegie Institution has hosted extraordinary
researchers from a wide range of scientific disciplines as part
of the Capital Science Evenings lecture series. The lectures
provide a unique opportunity to connect with some of the most
gifted investigators in science and hear the stories behind
their discoveries.

All lectures are free and open to the public, and begin at 6:45 PM
at the Carnegie Institute for Science.
These hour-long lectures, followed by a brief
question and answer period, go beyond the media accounts for a
firsthand look at the “ah-ha” moments, the setbacks, and the triumphs
that drive brilliant minds and fundamentally change our understanding
of the world around us.

Registration is required. You can [register online](https://carnegiescience.edu/events/lectures/dr-piers-sellers-creating-science-global-ecology-0).

####  Creating The Science Of Global Ecology

Over the last 30 years, the business of understanding and modeling the Earth's
biosphere has evolved. During the early 1980s, simple climate models showed
that global warming could be a real threat, but these models were roundly
criticized for having unrealistic descriptions of the interactions between the
atmosphere and the land, the oceans, and the planet's frozen surfaces. It was
clear that climate models had to be hugely improved to be credible as
predictive tools. Since then, biologists, atmospheric scientists, and remote
sensing experts have combined their skills to embed realistic biosphere models
into climate models, and have demonstrated that satellite data can be used to
initialize, calibrate, and validate these models. This was done using first
principles biological and physical research, large scale field experiments, and
global scale satellite data analyses. We can now realistically model the
continental energy, water and carbon cycles.
