excerpt: >
   The Annual Sackler Lecture is held in conjunction with one colloquium each
   year and is free and open to the public. Usually hosted in the spring in
   Washington, DC, the lecture draws an audience from the diverse academic,
   government, and policy communities in the area as well as registered
   colloquium participants.

Science progresses by an iterative process whereby discoveries build upon a
foundation of established facts and principles. The integrity of the advancement
of knowledge depends crucially on the reliability and reproducibility of our
published results. Although mistakes and falsification of results have always
been an unfortunate part of the process, most viewed scientific research as
self-correcting; the incorrect results and conclusions would inevitably be
challenged and replaced with more reliable information. But what happens if the
process is corrupted by systematic errors brought about by the misapplication of
statistics, the use of unreliable reagents and inappropriate cell models, and
the pressure to publish in the most selective venues? We may be facing this
scenario now in areas of biomedical science in which claims have been made that
a majority of the most important work in, for example, cancer biology is not
reproducible in the hands of drug companies that would seek to rely on the
biomedical literature for opportunities in drug discovery.

Authoritative reports have appeared that suggest a pressure to publish flashy,
positive results. These reports also suggest that as many as 75% of the key
experiments of highly cited papers in cancer biology cannot be replicated under
rigorous conditions in independent laboratories (Begley & Ellis 2012, Ioannidis
2005).

Self-correction of these errors may work in the long run, but short-term, we
have a problem with the acceptance of science by a public that may not
appreciate the scientific method. And equally importantly, we rely on the
federal government for the support of our work, and the key legislative leaders
may wonder whether the enormous public investment in biomedical science is
wasted on sloppy or fraudulent work.

Highly selective journals bear some responsibility for the pressure scholars
feel to publish their most important work.  This lecture will explore simple
reforms that may help journals to influence the attitudes of scholars and of the
editors who serve as the gatekeepers of our creative enterprise.

The Annual Sackler Public Lecture is free and open to the public, however
[reservations are
required](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2017-annual-arthur-m-sackler-lecture-the-challenge-of-reproducibility-in-the-biomedical-sciences-tickets-30227133169)
and attendees must present government issued photo identification (drivers
license, state ID, passport, etc.) for admittance. The lecture is presented in
conjunction with the Sackler Colloquium Reproducibility of Research: Issues and
Proposed Remedies being held March 8-10 in Washington D.C.
