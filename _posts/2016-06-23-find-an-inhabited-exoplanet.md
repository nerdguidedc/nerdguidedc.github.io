The NASA Kepler Mission taught us that Earth-sized planets are commonplace
throughout the galaxy. But did life take root on any of these distant worlds?
David Charbonneau, professor of astronomy at Harvard University, will discuss
how, using upcoming large telescopes, astronomers will search the atmospheres of
Earth-like planets for the telltale chemical fingerprints of life.

The event is free and open to the public but
[advance tickets](http://airandspace.si.edu/events/tickets)
are required.

### Exploring Space Lecture Series

**Life in the Solar System and Beyond**

Exploration of our solar system has revealed a great diversity of
worlds and a variety of unexpected environments. Could they support
simple life? Candidate locations include an ocean of water under
Europa's frigid crust and subsurface regions of Enceladus that have
been tantalizingly revealed by active geysers. New technologies are
enabling the search for worlds with habitable environments beyond
the solar system as well, and on our own planet, extreme environments
where life exists can be studied as planetary analogs. In this
series, four distinguished speakers will describe the latest
developments as we look for life in a lot of strange places.
Exploring Space lectures are suitable for ages 11 and up.
