### Poetry: Words in Motion

January 6, 10:30 am  
January 7,8,14,15 1:00 pm  

Come find inspiration in the Gallery’s permanent collection. In this workshop,
discover playful connections of shape, color, and line in Alexander Calder's
high-flying mobiles by experimenting with short form poetry.

Led by local writers, including playwrights and poets, this series of workshops
uses examination of works of art as a starting point for writing original
pieces. Through writing exercises and conversation, participants will explore
the elements of writing and experience works of art through a different lens.
The workshops are designed for all skill levels; beginning and advanced
participants are welcome.

This program is free and open to the public, but prior registration is
required due to limited space. Participants should bring their own
writing materials. [Reserve a space online](http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/education/adults/writing-salon.html)
starting at noon on Tuesday, January 3. Ages 18 and over.
