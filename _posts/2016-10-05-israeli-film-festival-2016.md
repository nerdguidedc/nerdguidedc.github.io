[Seret DC](https://www.wjff.org/seretdc/) is a cinematic survey of some of
Israel’s top films from the past year.

Some of the films to be screened are:

### Atomic Falafel

A nuclear showdown between Israel and Iran would not normally score high on the
laugh-riot meter. But writer-director Dror Shaul manages to raise the weighty
premise to high levels of absurdity in his farcical comedy Atomic Falafel.

Nofar is a sassy Israeli teen who desperately wants to lose her virginity. Her
Facebook friend, Sharareh, is an equally sassy Iranian
singer-songwriter-rapper. Nofar’s mom sells falafels from a van she navigates
through danger zones and has recently taken up with Oli, a German atomic energy
investigator who has an allergic reaction to enriched uranium.  They all become
pawns and players in a bizarre military plot cooked up by buffoonish defense
and intelligence operatives.

### Abulele

Ancient legends warn children about the Abulele – enormous, furry and sometimes
dangerous monsters who are able to hide among the human race by making
themselves invisible except to special children who are in need of a friend.

In this heartfelt family film, Adam, a young boy grieving from the loss of his
brother, discovers an Abulele living in his building. But when Adam realizes
that it is not the Abulele but the humans who are the real monsters, he risks
everything to save his friendly giant.

### One Week And A Day

When Eyal finishes sitting shiva (the traditional Jewish week of mourning) for
his late son, his wife Vicky urges him to return to their daily routine.
Instead, he gets high with a young neighbor and sets out to discover that there
are still things in his life worth living for.

As Vicky fights off school teachers, stray kittens and dental clinic workers,
Eyal gets loopier by the minute, vibrating on a frequency caught between goofy
childishness, and a state of complete mental breakdown. A black comedy that
borrows from the best traditions of stoner comedies and family dramas, One Week
and A Day is in the end a therapeutic journey full of laughs and genuine,
unadulterated responses to the deepest loss imaginable.
