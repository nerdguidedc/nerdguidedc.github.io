  On Friday May 13, ten young scientists spin tall-but-true tales of
  climate change, a cure for cancer, the search for life elsewhere, and
  much more - in 3 powerpoint-free minutes each!

[FameLab](http://astrobiology.arc.nasa.gov/) was set up in 2005 by
Cheltenham Festivals in partnership with the UK’s
National Endowment for Science, Technology, and the Arts (NESTA) to find and
nurture scientists and engineers with an interest in communicating with public
audiences. Since 2007, via a partnership with the British Council, FameLab has
gone global, with competitions now held in 20+ countries across Europe, Asia,
Africa, Australia, and North America.

Globally more than 4000 researchers have taken part. The result is a vibrant
network of exciting scientists and engineers engaging international audiences
but also engaging with each other, broadening each other’s views of what it
means to be working in science right now.

On May 13 three experts will judge ten young scientists as they spin
tall-but-true tales of climate change, a cure for cancer, the search for life
elsewhere, and much more - in 3 powerpoint-free minutes each. Come cheer on
these brave souls – vote for your favorite – and journey with them to the
cutting edge of exploring Earth and beyond! Reception to follow the main event.

The event is free and open to the public but registration is required.
