Dr. Tiffany Stern, Professor of Early Modern Drama at Oxford
University, presents a lecture on the relationship between ballads
and Shakespeare’s plays on stage and page. Considering the way ballads
were traded at playhouses, sung in plays, performed as post-play
entertainments, and sold to promote playbooks, Stern examines how
ballads, in performance and in broadsheets, came to advertise
Shakespeare – and how Shakespeare’s plays, in performance and in
playbooks, came to advertise ballads.

conversations with the Shakespeare Anniversary Lecture Series
