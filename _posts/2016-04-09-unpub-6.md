  The Unpublished Games Network, also known as Unpub, is an organization that
  helps aspiring game designers establish contacts in the industry, have their

  game published. On April 9 and 10 will be the sixth annual Unpublished
  Games Festival (Unpub 6) at the Baltimore Convention Center in Baltimore, Maryland.
  With over 90 game designers, two incredible special guests (Eric Lang and Rob Daviau),
  more vendors, and more play testers we are estimating a public attendance of over 2,000 people.

The Unpublished Games Network, also known as Unpub, is an organization that helps
aspiring game designers establish contacts in the industry, have their games
play-tested, and hone their craft to reach the dream of having their game
published. Unpub does all this through an annual Unpublished Games Festival,
presence at major conventions (PAX East, Origins, GenCon, and BGG.Con), and
with the Unpub Mini Program's partnerships with friendly local game stores.
The Unpub.net website contains hundreds of designer-posted games and houses
even more electronic feedback forms for all listed designs.

In the past 5 years, Unpub has moved from a small community meeting hall in
Dover, Delaware to a 14,000+ sq. ft. space in the Baltimore Convention Center.
On April 9, 2016, we will host our sixth annual Unpublished Games Festival
(Unpub 6) at the Baltimore Convention Center in Baltimore, Maryland.
With over 90 game designers, two incredible special guests (Eric Lang
and Rob Daviau), more vendors, and more play testers we are estimating a
public attendance of over 2,000 people - that is TWICE last year's attendance!
This is an exciting time of growth for Unpub and one in which we hope you
can be a part.

General Play Testing is free and open to the public. You can be a Registered
Play Tester for $5. More information is available on the
[Unpub Games Festival](http://unpub6.unpub.net/) website.
