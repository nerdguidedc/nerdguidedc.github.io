From the founders of [AtlasObscura.com](http://www.atlasobscura.com/), Joshua Foer and Dylan Thuras, with
co-author Ella Morton, this one-of-a-kind guide, complete with photographs,
maps, and charts, shares over 700 of the most mysterious bucket-list wonders
across all eight continents. Wonders include:

* A fire that’s been burning in the Turkmenistan desert for 40 years.
* Thousands of synchronized fireflies that inexplicably flash in unison in a
cluster of mangrove trees outside Kuala Lumpur.
* The self-mummifying monks of Japan.
* The world’s only museum dedicated to displaying art made from human hair.

From the Glowworm Caves of New Zealand to the bioluminescent squid of Toyama
Bay, each entry for the astonishing sites in Atlas Obscura includes location
information and tips on when and how best to get there—and how much to bribe
the guard to get you inside.

An immersive cabinet of curiosities that’s meant to inspire wonderlust as much
as wanderlust by sharing places that could never be found without a tip from
someone in the know, Atlas Obscura proves that the world is vast and there are
marvelous treasures behind every corner—if you just know where to look.

Tickets are $15 a person, $35 one person and one book, and $45
two people and one book. More information [available
online](https://www.sixthandi.org/event/joshua-foer-dylan-thuras-ella-morton/).
