Please join us for the launch of Evan Michelson's new book, *Assessing the
Societal Implications of Emerging Technologies: Anticipatory Governance in
Action*, which offers tangible insights into strategies deployed by
well-known, high-profile organizations involved in anticipating the societal
and policy implications of nanotechnology and synthetic biology.

The book lays out one of the first actionable roadmaps that interested
stakeholders can follow when working toward institutionalizing anticipatory
governance practices throughout the policymaking process.

David Rejeski, director of the Science & Technology Innovation Program at
the Wilson Center, will lead the discussion. A light lunch will be served
at noon.

This event is free and open to the public but [registration is
required](http://pages.wilsoncenter.org/06.09.2016AssessingtheSocietalImplicationsofEmergingTechnologiesBookLaunch_Registration.html).
