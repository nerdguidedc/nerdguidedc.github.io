A major focus of the field of chemistry is predicting how various atoms form
bonds, hence molecules, and how such bonding controls the structure and
properties of molecular matter. Historically, almost all chemistry has been
performed at ambient pressure - the atmospheric pressure at the Earth's surface.
However, the majority of matter in the universe resides at extreme pressures
and temperatures that force atoms into extremely close contact, where
chemical behavior can become surprising, and where very exotic compounds
can become stable. During this lecture, Dr. Goncharov will explain how we do
experiments at extreme pressures, in some cases exceeding one million
atmospheres. He will present some recent discoveries of unusual "salts,"
and stable compounds with noble gases. These exotic materials hold a promise
of potentially unparalleled physical and chemical properties. Many of these
newly discovered extreme materials are made of the most abundant elements
in the universe and thus are likely to be present in the interiors of giant
planets such as Jupiter and Saturn.
