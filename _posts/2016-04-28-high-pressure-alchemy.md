A major focus of the field of chemistry is predicting how various atoms form
bonds, hence molecules, and how such bonding controls the structure and
properties of molecular matter. Historically, almost all chemistry has been
performed at ambient pressure - the atmospheric pressure at the Earth's surface.
However, the majority of matter in the universe resides at extreme pressures
and temperatures that force atoms into extremely close contact, where
chemical behavior can become surprising, and where very exotic compounds
can become stable. During this lecture, Dr. Goncharov will explain how we do
experiments at extreme pressures, in some cases exceeding one million
atmospheres. He will present some recent discoveries of unusual "salts,"
and stable compounds with noble gases. These exotic materials hold a promise
of potentially unparalleled physical and chemical properties. Many of these
newly discovered extreme materials are made of the most abundant elements
in the universe and thus are likely to be present in the interiors of giant
planets such as Jupiter and Saturn.

The Broad Branch Road Neighborhood Lectures provide an opportunity to get up
close and personal with Carnegie scientists at our campus in northwest
Washington DC. These lectures begin at 6:30 p.m. and last for approximately one
hour, followed by a brief question and answer period. Doors open to the public
at 6:00 p.m. with light refreshments. The campus is located at the intersection
of Broad Branch Road and 32nd Street in northwest Washington, DC. Parking is
available on campus and accessible via Jocelyn and 32nd Streets. Street parking
is permissible. The campus is a short, three-block walk from Connecticut Avenue
and two blocks south of Military Road.
