Since 1991, the Carnegie Institution has hosted extraordinary
researchers from a wide range of scientific disciplines as part
of the Capital Science Evenings lecture series. The lectures
provide a unique opportunity to connect with some of the most
gifted investigators in science and hear the stories behind
their discoveries.

All lectures are free and open to the public, and begin at 6:45 PM
at the Carnegie Institute for Science.
These hour-long lectures, followed by a brief
question and answer period, go beyond the media accounts for a
firsthand look at the “ah-ha” moments, the setbacks, and the triumphs
that drive brilliant minds and fundamentally change our understanding
of the world around us.

Registration is required. You can [register online](https://carnegiescience.edu/events/lectures/dr-nadrian-seeman-dna-not-merely-secret-life).

####  DNA: Not Merely The Secret Of Life

Everyone learns in school that DNA is the genetic coding material  found in all
organisms. However, the information storage capacity that enables DNA to
function in the world of biology can also be exploited to control the creation
of 3D molecular structures. Dr. Seeman will talk about how DNA can be
programmed readily to make objects, crystals, and even nanomechanical devices!

Dr. Nadrian Seeman, Margaret and Herman Sokol Professor of Chemistry, New York University
