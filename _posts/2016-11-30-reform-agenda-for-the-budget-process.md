Reforming the federal budget process to achieve more timely budgets that
allocate resources more efficiently and in line with national goals has been a
focus of congressional hearings and public policy conversation in recent months.
After conducting nine hearings with more than 35 witnesses in the 114th
Congress, the House Committee on the Budget is poised to take the next step in
its effort to reform the budget process.

On Wednesday, November 30, Economic Studies at Brookings and the Committee for a
Responsible Federal Budget will host an event featuring Chairman of the House
Budget Committee Tom Price, M.D. (R-Ga.) on his proposed reforms of the budget
rules that could shape next year’s federal budget and its progress through
Congress. After the discussion, Rep. Price and panelists will take questions
from the audience. The event will be webcast live.
