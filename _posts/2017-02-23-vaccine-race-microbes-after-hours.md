Veteran medical journalist Meredith Wadman will discuss her book The Vaccine
Race. It tells the timely, epic, and controversial story of the development of
the first widely-used normal human cell line and, through it, important viral
vaccines, including the vaccine for rubella (German measles). Far from being an
instrument of history, vaccine development in the modern era is targeting new
(and reemerging) infectious diseases, including Ebola, Zika, Influenza and
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). Dr. April Killikelly, a scientist at NIH's
Vaccine Research Center, will discuss the latest tools and technologies used to
design tomorrow’s vaccines. Following the discussion, Dr. Wadman will be signing
copies of The Vaccine Race. We will have copies available for purchase on site
via credit/debit card only.

Due to limited seating, you must

out fast. The talks will start promptly at 6:00 p.m. ET (please arrive at 5:45
pm).

Meredith Wadman is a neuroscience reporter at Science magazine in Washington,
D.C. Before joining Science, Wadman was an editorial fellow at New America, a
Washington, D.C. think tank. Prior to that, she was a reporter covering the
medical research community for Nature for 17 years. She has also written on
biotech and on biomedical policy issues for The New York Times, The Washington
Post, The Wall Street Journal, Time and Fortune magazine. Wadman is a graduate
of Stanford University and completed medical school at Oxford, where she was a
Rhodes Scholar. She also earned a master's degree at the graduate school of
journalism at Columbia University.

Dr. April Killikelly

Postdoctoral Fellow, Vaccine Research Center, National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Disease, National Institutes of Health

Dr. Killikelly is a Postdoctoral fellow working on a vaccine for Respiratory
Syncytial Virus (RSV) with Dr. Barney Graham at the Vaccine Research Center
(NIAID/VRC). She is also a special volunteer with the Outreach and Education
office of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History. She is
passionate about using outreach and education to place science in the broader
context of culture and as drivers for societal change.

In May 2012, the American Society for Microbiology launched a Happy Hour series
called “Microbes After Hours” which gathers together scientists and curious
citizens at ASM headquarters in Washington DC for relaxed evenings of
appetizers, drinks, and exciting microbiology talks by renowned experts.  Since
the inaugural session, the series has tackled topics such as “Microbes and
Microbrews: the Microbiology of Brewing Beer,” “The Human Microbiome: My
Microbes, Myself,” and “The Return of Influenza.”  The series has grown beyond
its local roots to bring together scientists and enthusiastic learners from all
over the globe through live broadcasts on MicrobeWorld. Join ASM for this series
of events open to both ASM members and non-members alike.
