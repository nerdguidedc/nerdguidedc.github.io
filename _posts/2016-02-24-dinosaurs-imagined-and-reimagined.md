Walk through time with Matthew Carrano, Curator of Dinosauria, as he
explores the history and special effects of dinosaurs in popular film.

Whether campy or surreal, scary or comical, these specially selected
film clips reveal how movie dinosaurs have inspired audiences
(including scientists) for the better part of a century. 

This event is at the National Museum of Natural History. The event
is free but [advance registration](https://www.facebook.com/events/1290117051013702/) is required.
