excerpt: >
  On Sep 23 Craig Kundrot will talk about a twin's study at NASA of  
  US Astronaut Scott Kelly and twin brother, Mark Kelly, a retired US
  Astronaut. A very broad range of biological functions are being examined at
  the same time in both twins, including the genome, epigenome, transcriptome,
  proteome, metabolome, gut microbiome, immunological response to vaccinations,
  indicators of atherosclerosis, physiological fluid shifts, and cognition.

The [Philosophical Society of Washington](http://www.philsoc.org/)
Lectures are selected to
appeal to those with a general interest in science and do not require
a specialized knowledge of the subject. They always contain
information that is current, explanations that are understandable
and a few controversial issues to be challenged by a critical
listener. The series is designed as much as possible to include a
wide range of disciplines.

The meetings are open to the public, free, and no reservations are
required. Dress is informal. Meetings are followed by lively
conversation. All must exit the Cosmos Club at 10:30 p.m.
Conversations are continued at another location.

The full array of 21st century “omics"-based research methods should be
intelligently employed to reduce the health and performance risks that
astronauts will be exposed to during exploration missions beyond Low Earth
Orbit.

In March of 2015, US Astronaut Scott Kelly launched to the International Space
Station for a one year mission while his twin brother, Mark Kelly, a retired US
Astronaut, remained on the ground. This situation presented an extremely rare
flight opportunity to perform an integrated omics-based demonstration pilot
study involving identical twin astronauts. A group of 10 principal
investigators was  competitively selected, funded, and teamed together to form
the Twins Study. A very broad range of biological functions are being examined
at the same time in both twins, including the genome, epigenome, transcriptome,
proteome, metabolome, gut microbiome, immunological response to vaccinations,
indicators of atherosclerosis, physiological fluid shifts, and cognition.  

The design of the Twins Study and an overview of initial results will be
presented in this lecture, and the technological and ethical issues raised by
for such spaceflight studies will be discussed. An anticipated outcome of the
Twins Study is that it will place NASA on a trajectory of using omics-based
information to develop precision countermeasures for individual astronauts to
address adverse effects of spaceflight and maintain astronaut health on long
duration exploration  missions.

Craig Kundrot is the Life Sciences Lead in the Office of the Chief Scientist at
NASA where he coordinates life science research in astrobiology, human research,
planetary protection and space biology within NASA and with other organizations.

Before joining NASA Craig was an x-crystallographer and worked on protein and
RNA structure-function relationships at Yale, the Medical Research Council
Laboratory for Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, and the University of
Colorado. He continued this work at NASA before assuming science management
positions for biotechnology and materials science. He then served as the Deputy
Chief Scientist for NASA’s Human Research Program (HRP) and as the first Mission
Scientist for the HRP’s Twins Study.  He also served as Chair of the
Institutional Review Board at NASA Johnson Space Center helping formulate NASA’s
genetic research policy for astronauts.

During his NASA Career Craig has been awarded three Center Director
commendations and six Special Service Awards. He earned a BA in Integrated
Science with a minor in Biochemistry at Northwestern University a MPhil and PhD
in Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry at Yale.

The John Wesley Powell Auditorium is adjacent to the Cosmos Club, 2170 Florida
Avenue NW, Washington DC 20008. Entrance is through the club gate, the first
right-hand entrance on Florida Avenue north of the intersection with
Massachusetts Avenue NW. The auditorium entrance is to the left of the gate.
