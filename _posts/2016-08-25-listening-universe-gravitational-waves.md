Ira Thorpe will present "Listening to the Universe with Gravitational Waves."
Thorpe is an astrophysicist at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.

According to Thorpe, Albert Einstein’s theory of General Relativity predicted
the existence of gravitational waves, distortions of space-time that originate
in astrophysical cataclysms and carry energy and momentum across the universe at
the speed of light. A century later, scientists around the world have built
instruments to detect and observe the waves in an effort to learn more about the
cosmological events of our universe.

The event will be held in the Pickford Theater on third floor of the Madison
Building.
