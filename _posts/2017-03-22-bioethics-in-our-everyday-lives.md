Advances in life sciences are giving humans new capacities. New medicines,
biomedical procedures, and ways of altering plants and animals are bringing
benefits to millions of people. However, these same innovations also have the
potential to bring harm and raise other kinds of ethical questions about their
appropriate use. Join us for an evening of conversation and discussion with
experts from the National Institutes of Health, Kaiser Permanente, and the Johns
Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics as we explore how to make more informed
decisions in our own lives and how bioethics can effect public policy. Admission
is $7 ($5 for students) and includes complimentary refreshments. [Registration
is
