What does it mean to "innovate?" This was a question Radiolab host Jad Abumrad
was frequently asked after being awarded a MacArthur "Genius Grant" in 2011.
This multimedia exploration, on one level, is the personal story of how Jad
invented a new aesthetic. On another, it is a clinic in the art of storytelling.
On a third and more profound level, it is the result of a three-year
investigation into the science, philosophy and art of uncertainty, which all
began with the two words that are the title of this talk. "Gut Churn."

[Tickets](http://mcleancenter.org/calendar/icalrepeat.detail/2016/06/11/1086/-/gut-churn-from-radiolab-s-jad-abumrad) are $30/$15 for McLean Community Center district residents.
