Nerd Nite is a monthly event held in more than 75 cities across the globe during which several folks give 18-21-minute fun-yet-informative presentations across all disciplines – while the audience drinks along. Despite our similar names the Nerd Guide DC and Nerd Nite DC are unaffiliated but kindred spirits. Doors open at 6:00, show starts at 6:30. Tickets can be purchased at [dcnine.com](http://dcnine.com). More information available at the [Nerd Nite DC](https://dc.nerdnite.com) website. This is a 21+ event.

If you talk to scientists, designers and educators at the Smithsonian Natural History Museum, you’ll hear a lot about the Anthropocene, the current “proposed” geological epoch that is defined as the period of time when human activities began to significantly impact Earth’s geology and ecosystems. At this month’s Nerd Nite DC, experts at the museum are taking a step back in deep time to uncover chapters in Earth’s 4.6 billion-year-old story that might shed some light on where our chapter might lead. So get deeply nostalgic Natural History style at Nerd Nite this month. It’s going to be epoch!

#### Climate Change in the Past: What the Fossils Say

By Danielle Fraser

Some like it hot, others like it...not. We all know human-induced climate change is currently altering our planet in unpredictable ways. But, did you know that there were numerous other climate change events in Earth’s history. Some were rapid and some were slow, but all impacted Earth’s plants and animals, like the amazing giant rhinoceroses, tiny three toed horses, and primate oddities that have all disappeared from North America. During this talk, we are going to investigate why all these animals have disappeared, how we document past climate change events, and what can this past tell us about our unpredictable future.

Bio: Danielle Fraser is a Peter Buck Postdoctoral Scholar in Paleontology at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, where her primary academic interests are in understanding how past climate changes have affected communities of mammals. She received her PhD in Biology from Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, and yes, during this talk, she might say “eh!”

#### What the Heck Was That For?  

By Silvia Pineda-Munoz

It is the task of paleontologists to look at the fossil record and understand how were the lives of past organisms. What is the relationship between shape and function? How does that weird thingy hanging off their head have anything to do with anything? Why does this apparent land animal have huge wings? It is well known that animals evolve to adapt to their environment, however, understanding how the environment has shaped an animals body or behavior is not an easy task. At this talk, we will discuss how things are not always what they seem, and what nifty tools science uses to solve these fossilized mysteries.

Bio: Silvia Pineda-Munoz is a postdoctoral fellowship for the Evolution of Terrestrial Ecosystems (ETE) program at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. She is a Catalan who did her PhD down-under in Macquarie University, Sydney. Sílvia is interested in studying the dynamics of body evolution through time. Other than traveling, she loves hiking mountains, climbing walls and crafting things.

#### Death From Above: How to Survive an Asteroid Impact?

By Antoine Bercovici

For the non-avian dinosaurs, Armageddon came from the sky in the form of an asteroid the size of Washington D.C., slamming into the Yucatan Peninsula 66.043 million years ago. But dinosaurs were not the only casualties, as many other species of animals and plants, both on land and in the sea, went extinct at the same time. What lessons about evolution and the history of the Earth can we learn from this ancient catastrophe that paved the way for the reign of humanity?

Bio: Antoine is a paleopalynologist (the study of fossil pollen and spores) at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. He received his PhD at the University of Rennes 1 in France. He is interested in understanding how terrestrial plant communities have responded to mass extinction events during Earth’s history. As he is allergic to his own study subject, he thanks the evolution of human medicine for allowing him to bring you this presentation!
