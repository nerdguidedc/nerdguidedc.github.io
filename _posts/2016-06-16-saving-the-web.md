Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn, who are considered the "fathers of the internet,"
will join Dame Wendy Hall and other scholars and practitioners of internet
and digital studies for a symposium on the challenges of preserving the
contents of the web, on June 16 at the John W. Kluge Center,
Library of Congress.

The day-long symposium, "Saving the Web: The Ethics and Challenges of
Preserving What's on the Internet," is free and open to the public.

The conference is hosted by Dame Wendy Hall, professor of computer science
at the University of Southampton, who currently holds the 2016 Kluge Chair
in Technology and Society. As Kluge Chair, Hall has been in residence at
the Library for three months researching the social, economic, and technical
dimensions of the web. She has also met extensively with Library personnel
and the larger Washington policymaking community to discuss web-archiving
strategies.

According to Hall, preserving the contents of the web is an increasingly
vital activity for governments, libraries and universities. The web is a
massive global information system, and yet significant amounts of its contents
disappear daily. The average web page remains online for barely 100 days.
The symposium brings together experts in fields of computer science,
information science, behavioral science, archives, media studies,
communications and more to discuss major issues surrounding web preservation,
the future potential of web archives to researchers and scholars, and the
challenges in web archiving.

In addition to Hall, Cerf, and Kahn, speakers scheduled to appear include
Jefferson Bailey of the Internet Archive; Ramesh Jain of the University
of California, Irvine; Lee Rainie, of the Pew Research Center; James
Hendler of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; and Katy BÃ¶rner of Indiana
University Bloomington. Participants from a two-day "datathon" organized
by Matthew Weber of Rutgers University and hosted by the Library earlier
that week will also present their findings from working with the Library's
digital collections, including data from the 2000, 2004 and 2008 presidential
elections. [A full schedule of speakers is available](https://www.loc.gov/loc/kluge/news/save-web-2016.html).
