Lt. Col. Christine Mau is no stranger to making history.  She entered the Air
Force after graduating from the United States Air Force Academy in 1997, just 4
years after the Combat Exclusion Law was lifted allowing women to fly in
combat.  She became part of the select community of fighter pilots after pilot
training and remains among the small percentage of women who pilot fighter
aircraft today. Her combat hours include Operations Southern Watch, Northern
Watch, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom.  She led the first combat mission
planned, briefed, launched, and flown entirely by women in 2011 while flying
the F-15E. She is also the first and only woman to pilot the Department of
Defense's newest fighter, the F-35. She has achieved numerous successes as an
officer and aviator and today serves as the Deputy Commander of the 33rd
Operations Group at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida.
In this lecture, Lt. Col. Mau will discuss her journey accumulating more than
2,300 hours in the F-15E and F-35A.

The event is free and open to the public but [advance
tickets](https://airandspace.si.edu/events/views-cockpit-f-35) are required.
