Celebrate FotoWeekDC at the National Air and Space Museum during Creative
Control: After Hours with Art of the Airport Tower, a 21+ program.

When Smithsonian photographer and museum specialist Carolyn Russo looks at an
airport tower, she sees its unique personality traits. She sees Swiss cheese,
birds, and top hats, and for nearly ten years she traveled to 23 countries to
photograph airport towers and share their beauty and history with the world.

Join us for a special after-hours program to tour the Art of the Airport Tower
exhibition and go on a photographic journey to airports in the United States and
around the globe. The exhibition explores the varied forms and functions of air
traffic control towers throughout aviation history and interprets them as
technological monuments, abstractions, and expressions of culture and time.

Throughout the evening, explore the fusion of photography and aviation:

* Russo will be on hand to discuss her creative process and inspiration for the
project, while mixing in a few good stories from the road—and tarmac.
* Love photography but don’t have a DSLR of your own? Photographer Sam Krisch,
renowned for his iPhone photography, will teach you how to get the most from
the camera in your pocket. Then, put that knowledge to use snapping photos in
our photo-worthy museum.
* Need some artistic inspiration? We’re opening the vaults of the Museum’s
photo archives to show you some of the wackiest photos in our collection and
share the stories behind them.
* Don’t miss this last chance to explore the Art of the Airport Tower gallery
after hours before it closes on November 30!
* Light refreshments and a cash bar will be provided.

Please note: limited galleries will be open for viewing.

All participants must be 21 or older. Valid ID required for entry. Tickets cost
$20 and must be [reserved in advance](https://airandspace.si.edu/events/creative-control-after-hours-art-airport-tower).
