The [Philosophical Society of Washington](http://www.philsoc.org/)
Lectures are selected to
appeal to those with a general interest in science and do not require
a specialized knowledge of the subject. They always contain
information that is current, explanations that are understandable
and a few controversial issues to be challenged by a critical 
listener. The series is designed as much as possible to include a
wide range of disciplines.

The meetings are open to the public, free, and no reservations are
required. Dress is informal. Meetings are followed by lively
conversation. All must exit the Cosmos Club at 10:30 p.m.
Conversations are continued at another location.

#### The Exploration of Pluto

Alan Stern  
Principal Scientist, New Horizons  
Vice President for Research, Southwest Research Institute  
CEO, Uwingu and The Golden Spike Company  

New Horizons is NASA’s historic $723M mission to explore the Pluto
system and the Kuiper Belt. The fastest spacecraft ever launched,
it left Earth on 19 January 2006. It made the first exploration
of the Pluto system, 3 billion miles from Earth, in 2015, culminating
with a highly successful flyby inside the orbits of all five of
Pluto’s moons on July 14th. The spacecraft carries a sophisticated
payload of imagers and other scientific instruments that have
revolutionized our knowledge of Pluto and its five moons. This
lecture will describe the history of the mission, the science
behind it, the capabilities of the instrument payload, its encounter
with Pluto, and the major scientific discoveries by New Horizons to
date.  The lecture will also outline the proposed New Horizons extended
mission to fly across the Kuiper Belt, exploring even further into
space beyond the Pluto system.

The John Wesley Powell Auditorium is adjacent to the Cosmos Club,
2170 Florida Avenue NW, Washington DC 20008. Entrance is through 
the club gate, the first right-hand entrance on Florida Avenue north
of the intersection with Massachusetts Avenue NW. The auditorium
entrance is to the left of the gate.
