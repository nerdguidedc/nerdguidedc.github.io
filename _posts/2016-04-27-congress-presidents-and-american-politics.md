Recently awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, former member of Congress
Lee Hamilton reflects on Congress and the Presidency and the lessons to be
learned from years past. When he joined the Congress in 1965 as a U.S.
Representative from southern Indiana, he began writing commentaries for his
constituents describing his experiences, impressions, and developing views of
what was right and wrong in American politics. His service in the House spanned
many national milestones over 50 years: the protests of the sixties, the Vietnam
War, and the Great Society reforms, the Watergate and Iran-Contra affairs, and
the post-9/11 years as the vice chairman of the 9/11 commission.

Joining the conversation will be moderator Tom Edsall, New York Times columnist,
and Ray LaHood, former Secretary of Transportation, former member of Congress,
and author of Seeking Bipartisanship: My Life in Politics.

A book signing will follow the program. Purchase this book on the day of the
