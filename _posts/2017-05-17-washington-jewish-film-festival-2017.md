One of the largest and most respected Jewish film festivals in North America,
the [Washington Jewish Film Festival](https://www.wjff.org) (WJFF) is an
international exhibition of cinema that celebrates the diversity of Jewish
history, culture and experience through the moving image. In addition to the
annual festival, the WJFF presents an ongoing, year-round film series, in our
home venue at the Edlavitch DCJCC.

The WJFF annually serves over 15,000 people through 80+ screenings, nearly all
of which are regional, US or world premieres. Most screenings are followed by
discussions with guest filmmakers and subject matter experts.

Saturday screenings before 6:15pm are pre-sale only in observance of Shabbat.
Tickets to these screenings will not be available for purchase at the door.

Some of the films to be screened are:

### Holy Zoo

In Jerusalem’s Biblical Zoo, Israelis and Palestinians work hand in hand. The
staff casually discusses politics and recent terrorist incidents while cleaning
rhino horns, feeding giraffes, and tracking down an escaped monkey. They lead
separate tours for the area’s Muslim and Jewish students, with each group
focusing on different aspects of the animals’ anatomy and biblical relevance.
Holy Zoo is an observational documentary that gently shifts our perspective on
the seemingly intractable realities of the Middle East conflict.

### OMG I'm A Robot

Dumped by his sweetheart on account of being too sensitive, Danny is overwhelmed
with sadness and decides to cut himself—only to discover that instead of blood,
sparks shoot out and spliced wires protrude—turns out he’s a robot!

Newly armed with the self-confidence of an indestructible killing machine, he
sets about winning back his love, who meanwhile appears to have been kidnapped.
The “way-out-there” sci-fi plot makes for pure giddy entertainment and escapism
with surprising depth to boot.

### Supergirl

When a nine-year-old girl breaks a powerlifting world record, she turns into an
international phenomenon, and “Supergirl” is born. Naomi Kutin seems like a
typical Orthodox Jewish pre-teen until her extraordinary talent transforms the
lives of her family and thrusts her into news headlines.

Supergirl follows Naomi’s unique coming-of-age story as she fights to hold on to
her title while navigating the perils of adolescence—from strict religious
obligations to cyber-bullying and health concerns that could jeopardize her
future in powerlifting.
