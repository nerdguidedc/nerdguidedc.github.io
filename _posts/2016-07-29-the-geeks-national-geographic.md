  Nerd out at an event that would make the first geeks—the Greeks—proud.
  As the inventors of democracy, geometry, philosophy, and the toga party,
  no one worked harder (or played harder) than the Greeks. Embody the Greek
  spirit of adventure, ideas, and exploration with National Geographic’s young
  explorers on an evening out at the National Geographic Museum on July 29.

Nerd out at an event that would make the first geeks—the Greeks—proud.
As the inventors of democracy, geometry, philosophy, and the toga party,
no one worked harder (or played harder) than the Greeks. Embody the Greek
spirit of adventure, ideas, and exploration with National Geographic’s young
explorers on an evening out. Hold on tight during this night of
expectation-defying science and uncontrollable laughter with eight Nat Geo
explorers fresh from the field.

Tickets are $15 and [available for purchase](http://events.nationalgeographic.com/washingtondc/2016/07/29/the-geeks-dc/) online. Free parking is
