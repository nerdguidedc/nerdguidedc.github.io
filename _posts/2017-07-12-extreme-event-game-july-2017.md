Summer in Washington, DC can be challenging. In addition to heat and humidity we also face the possibility of severe storms that can affect many neighborhoods around the city. Located at the confluence of the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers, combined with three buried waterways, relatively flat elevations, and a changing climate, DC is highly susceptible to flooding. So whatâ€™s a DC resident to do? Join us for our Extreme Event game to find out!

[Extreme Event](https://www.koshland-science-museum.org/extreme-event/) is an in-person role-playing game about disaster resilience that is full of twists, turns, and challenging surprises. Work together with other players to prioritize resources, solve challenges, and balance trade-offs.
