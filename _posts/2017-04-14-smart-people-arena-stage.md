Do our belief systems stem from our environment, or are some prejudices
hard-wired into us? With barbed wit, Lydia R. Diamond (Stick Fly) explores the
unavoidable nature of racism and other sticky subjects in the controversial and
fiercely funny new play Smart People. Four intellectuals — a doctor, an actress,
a psychologist, and a neurobiologist studying the human brain’s response to race —
search for love, acceptance and identity in a complex world where political
correctness comes face-to-face with cold hard data.

“It’s a play about race, interpersonal relationships and how the things we
struggle with around race, clash and play off each other." — Lydia R. Diamond

Smart People runs approximately two hours and thirty minutes, including one
15-minute intermission. This production includes mature content and strobe-like
effects.

[Arena Stage](http://arenastage.org/) is a not-for-profit regional theater based
in Southwest, Washington, D.C. It was a pioneer in 1950 of the Regional Theater
Movement.
