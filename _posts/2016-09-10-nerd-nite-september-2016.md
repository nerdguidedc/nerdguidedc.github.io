excerpt: >
  Fall is almost here and its time to dry those poolside margaritas out of our
  brains and fill them instead with delicious...knowledge. Our speakers this
  month will take topics you thought you knew – like chocolate, biology and
  Frank Lloyd Wright – and turn them on their head with alternate perspectives.
  We will be talking about how chocolate can make you do much more than
  salivate, how biology is the new material of maker labs and how Frank Lloyd
  Wright’s life was even more interesting as his architecture. On September 10
  grab a beer at the bar and get ready to peel back the layers to see things in
  a whole new light!

Nerd Nite is a monthly event held in more than 75 cities across the globe
during which several folks give 18-21-minute fun-yet-informative
presentations across all disciplines – while the audience drinks along.
Despite our similar names the Nerd Guide DC and Nerd Nite DC are
unaffiliated but kindred spirits. Doors open at 6:00, show starts
at 6:30. Tickets are $10. More information available at the [Nerd Nite
DC](https://dc.nerdnite.com) website. This is a 21+ event.

**Cuckoo for Cocoa: Is Chocolate Addiction Real?**  

By Margaret Riley  

Have you ever experienced a chocolate craving? Have you ever wondered why?
During this talk we will dig into the sweet, gooey center of everyone’s
favorite treat and explore the pharmacological, neurochemical, and orosensory
effects of chocolate. Turns out your cravings aren’t all in your head—though
the brain might be responsible for turning some people into “chocaholics.”

Bio: Margaret Riley is a lover of all things chocolate and a self-educated
chocolate expert. She works as an attorney for the federal government, knows
all the offices in her workplace with candy bowls, and spends her free time
traveling the world hunting for the best cacao-based products. She’s an
Alexandria native and fan of anything geeky, as long as it’s covered in
chocolate.

**The House That Frank Built**

By Dan Siegal

The man, the myth, the legend: architect Frank Lloyd Wright.  He is celebrated
world over as the greatest American architect of all time, but what sort of
person was he?  We all have seen examples of his work, but we know very little
about the salacious life and mind behind the building genius. Come and learn
about formative events from his childhood, his many, MANY affairs, and the
house he built for his son that may or may not have been a “practice building”
for another project.

Bio: Meghan is a lawyer turned lobbyist who advocates on behalf of research
universities and scientific societies.  She became obsessed (in a totally
non-creepy way) with Frank Lloyd Wright after visiting Taliesin West in her
home state of Arizona, and has spent the years collecting facts, stories, and
little known anecdotes about the man behind the façade..

**Synthetic Biology: What Happens When Engineers Are Let Loose in the Biology
Lab**

By Dan Siegal

The biological world is really good at doing stuff, whether we humans like it
or not.  And every once in a while, biology provides us with something that we
can use: things like penicillin, or aspirin, or beer. But why should we be
limited to what biological systems “naturally” do?  What if we didn’t want to
wait around for the biology to come up with solutions for us? Synthetic
biology, a relatively new scientific field focused on the re-engineering of
biological organisms like bacteria and yeast, holds significant promise for the
future of biotechnology and medicine. Cheaper drugs, greener means to fuel our
cars, and targeted therapies for attacking diseases are all on the horizon
thanks to an intrepid group of biological hackers. So let’s talk biological
hacking – where we’ve been and where we’re headed in the not-too-distant future.

Bio: Dan Siegal serves as a scientific advisor to at least one U.S. government
agency (that he’s been told he’s not supposed to name in venues like this)
where he supports the development of research programs at the bleeding-edge of
systems and synthetic biology.  Dan is also the founder of and former
showrunner for the Columbus Science Pub (CBUs’ answer to Nerd Nite back in
2010) and got to briefly play with some Hollywood bigshots as a consultant as a
science advisor to Hollywood.
