Nerd Nite is a monthly event held in more than 75 cities across the globe
during which several folks give 18-21-minute fun-yet-informative
presentations across all disciplines – while the audience drinks along.
Despite our similar names the Nerd Guide DC and Nerd Nite DC are
unaffiliated but kindred spirits. Doors open at 6:00, show starts
at 6:30. Tickets are $10. More information available at the [Nerd Nite
DC](https://dc.nerdnite.com) website. This is a 21+ event.

### Nerd Nite Makes It a Winter Wonderland

Winter time can be cold and lonely. But we can also find love – and curiosity –
where we least expect it. From the mating habits of Antarctic plants to
unraveling the mysteries of polar ice from space using frickin’ lasers, Nerd
Nite is here to make you feel cozy and warm. So grab your special snowflake –
and learn about the many wild wonderful varieties of the white and fluffy stuff
– because we’re ready to embark into a winter wonderland of nerdery.

**Special Snowflakes, Slippery Sleet and the Beauty and Dangers of Winter
Weather**

Tim Di Liberto

Let it snow! Maybe. The white stuff can be dry and flaky, wet and sticky, and
anywhere in-between. And while we all enjoy a good snow day, meteorologists have
to keep a watchful eye on snowstorms that can shut down traffic, destroy
rooftops and generally be a source of wintertime blues – and insurance claims.
Snowstorms and snowflakes are surprisingly varied based on the environmental
conditions that shape it, so we’ll unpack the mysteries of all those special
snowflakes and get ready to pack the perfect science-based snowball.

Bio: Tom Di Liberto is a meteorologist, dad, and improv performer. He is the
winner of AAAS’s first Science Idol competition. During the day, he works the
levers of sophisticated climate models on behalf of a small government agency
named NOAA.

**Love on a Glacier**

Sam Oester

Antarctica is arguably one of the most remote places above sea level in the
world and is certainly the coldest place on Earth. Despite chilly temps and
severe conditions, Antarctica is the exclusive breeding locale of many species
and populations. These animals (and two plants!) reproduce on glaciers,
snowbanks, rocky shores, coastal mountains, and icy waters. They fight strong
winds, heavy snowfall, and ice storms to get it on, rear offspring, and survive
until the next breeding season. They also have to dodge human-induced pressures,
like climate change and commercial fishing, so yes, our activities are even
affecting a continent where no humans live. For endemic and endangered species
who live in Antarctica, a lot is riding on their ability to copulate. But their
love – or at least their impetus to reproduce – remains strong.

Bio: Samantha is a biologist, aquatic and coastal scientist, marine
conservationist, and explorer. She is a PhD research fellow in the George Mason
University College of Science and a doctoral candidate in environmental science
and policy. She studies ecosystems, wildlife, and aquatic microbes. She has
worked around the globe, and some of her favorite places have been the Antarctic
Peninsula, Ecuadorian Amazon, Himalayas, and Galápagos Islands.

**How do frickin’ “lasers” work? (And do they really go “pew pew pew”?)**

Christina Willis

Lasers are ubiquitous in our world today: they’re used to weld car frames, 3D
print cool stuff, make measurements, perform surgery and more! But what does the
inside of a laser look like, how do they work, and who invented them? More
importantly, can you make a lightsaber, or attach a laser to a shark? Get ready
to be amplified and stimulated as we spend some time getting cozy with lasers
and the amazing things they can do, including measuring frickin’ ice from
frickin’ orbit!

Bio: Christina is a laser scientist specializing in designing and building high
energy laser systems for making measurements at a distance, and she can tell you
the most painful wavelength of laser to get burned with! She was once featured
in Jorge Cham’s comic strip Piled Higher and Deeper for the 50th Anniversary of
the laser, and her career in lasers may or may not have been inspired by a 1980s
Val Kilmer movie.
