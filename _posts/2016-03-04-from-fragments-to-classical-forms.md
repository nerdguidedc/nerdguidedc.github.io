  explain why many of the bronzes in Power and Pathos are incomplete
  and why so many ancient bronzes have disappeared.

The [Philosophical Society of Washington](http://www.philsoc.org/)
Lectures are selected to
appeal to those with a general interest in science and do not require
a specialized knowledge of the subject. They always contain
information that is current, explanations that are understandable
and a few controversial issues to be challenged by a critical 
listener. The series is designed as much as possible to include a
wide range of disciplines.

The meetings are open to the public, free, and no reservations are
required. Dress is informal. Meetings are followed by lively
conversation. All must exit the Cosmos Club at 10:30 p.m.
Conversations are continued at another location.

#### From Fragments to Classical Forms: Reconstructing Greek Bronzes and the Greek and Roman Trade in Art

The exhibition Power and Pathos: Bronze Sculpture of the Hellenistic
World will be on view in the West Building of the National Gallery of
Art until March 20, 2016. The exhibition demonstrates how artists and
artisans captured the dynamic realism, expression, and detail that
characterized what we call ”Hellenistic.” This lecture will explain
why many of the bronzes in Power and Pathos are incomplete and why so
many ancient bronzes have disappeared. It will discuss several
questions about the bronzes: What did the complete statues look like?
What can we learn from the fragments we can recover? What were the
sculptures used for? Were all the bronzes "decorative" statues or did
some of them serve other functions? The lecture also will discuss the
mass production of bronzes in the Hellenistic world and the ancient
market for public and private statuary, and discuss its implications
for the modern concept that Greek bronzes were “originals,” a notion
derived from the few bronzes that have been recovered in modern times.

The John Wesley Powell Auditorium is adjacent to the Cosmos Club,
2170 Florida Avenue NW, Washington DC 20008. Entrance is through 
the club gate, the first right-hand entrance on Florida Avenue north
of the intersection with Massachusetts Avenue NW. The auditorium
entrance is to the left of the gate.
