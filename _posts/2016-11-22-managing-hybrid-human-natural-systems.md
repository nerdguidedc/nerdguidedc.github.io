excerpt: >
  Erle Ellis an environmental scientist and a professor of geography and
  environmental systems and director of the Laboratory of Anthropogenic
  Landscape Ecology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. For Ellis,
  human’s relationship with land stems from social and cultural behaviors – from
  our hunter-gatherer past, to our booming global industries today – and the
  changes on Earth’s landscapes reflect these societal behaviors and population
  pressures. November 22 at the Natural History Museum.

Erle Ellis an environmental scientist and a professor of geography and
environmental systems and director of the Laboratory of Anthropogenic Landscape
Ecology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.

For Ellis, human’s relationship with land stems from social and cultural
behaviors – from our hunter-gatherer past, to our booming global industries
today – and the changes on Earth’s landscapes reflect these societal behaviors
and population pressures. But, it’s not all bad.

Learn more from Ellis as he shares his optimistic view: humans have the
ability, and responsibility, to be Earth's stewards, managing hybrid
human-natural systems towards better outcomes for both humans and non-human
nature.

Offered as part of the Anthropocene: Life in the Age of Humans 3-part series
“Landscapes of the Anthropocene”, which explores our relationship with the land
that sustains us. To see more programs, visit the [Anthropocene: Life in the Age
of Humans](http://go.si.edu/site/SPageServer?pagename=life_in_anthropocene) homepage.

The event is free and open to the public but [advance registration is
required](http://go.si.edu/site/Calendar?view=Detail&id=101481&s_src=nerdguide_web_cal_er). Seating is limited.
