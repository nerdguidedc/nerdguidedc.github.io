John Sexton, president emeritus of New York University and a legal scholar,
will deliver a lecture at the Library of Congress on the future of
American research universities.

"The American Research University: The Decades Ahead" will take place in room
119 on the first floor of the Library's Thomas Jefferson Building. The event
is free and open to the public. Tickets are not needed.

In his lecture, Sexton will discuss how globalization, technology and market
forces are likely to reshape the form and function of the American
research university in coming decades.

Sexton is the current Kluge Chair in American Law and Governance at the
Library's John W. Kluge Center. He is president emeritus of New York
University (NYU) and also the Benjamin Butler Professor of Law at the
NYU School of Law. He is dean emeritus of the NYU School of Law, where
he served as dean for 14 years. He joined the law school's faculty in
1981, was named the school's dean in 1988, and was designated the
university's president in 2001.

While at the Kluge Center, Sexton has been working to convert into a
book a series of essays that reflect on the place and promise of
higher education. The essays "range from the role of universities as
places of sanctuary for civil discourse, to my vision of the global
network university, to meeting the pressing challenge of our time to
provide meaningful access worldwide to a college education," Sexton said.
