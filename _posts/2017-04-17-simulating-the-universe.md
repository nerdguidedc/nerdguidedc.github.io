  The formation of galaxies like our Milky Way involves gravity, dark matter,
  gases, star formation, and stellar explosions. Theoretical astrophysics is now
  revealing this complex process by using the world’s most powerful
  supercomputers to simulate galaxy formation. On April 17, Dr. Wetzel will
  describe dramatic new advances in understanding how galaxies form within the
  cosmic web of the Universe.

Since 1991, the Carnegie Institution has hosted extraordinary
researchers from a wide range of scientific disciplines as part
of the Capital Science Evenings lecture series. The lectures
provide a unique opportunity to connect with some of the most
gifted investigators in science and hear the stories behind
their discoveries.

All lectures are free and open to the public.
These hour-long lectures, followed by a brief
question and answer period, go beyond the media accounts for a
firsthand look at the “ah-ha” moments, the setbacks, and the triumphs
that drive brilliant minds and fundamentally change our understanding
of the world around us.

Registration is required. You can [register online](https://carnegiescience.edu/events/lectures/dr-pierre-cox-alma-search-our-cosmic-origins).

#### Simulating the Universe: One Galaxy at a Time

The formation of galaxies like our Milky Way involves gravity, dark matter,
gases, star formation, and stellar explosions. Theoretical astrophysics is now
revealing this complex process by using the world’s most powerful supercomputers
to simulate galaxy formation. Dr. Wetzel will describe dramatic new advances in
understanding how galaxies form within the cosmic web of the Universe.
