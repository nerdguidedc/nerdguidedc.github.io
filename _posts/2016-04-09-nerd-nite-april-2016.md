  April 12th is the anniversary of Yuri Gargarin’s ascent into space. Yuri’s
  Night is a World Space Party that celebrates the dream and the
  reality of Human Space Flight. We’ve teamed up with Astronomy on Tap
  DC and One Love Massive on Saturday, April 9th to add to the celebration
  and wonder of space by extending Nerd Nite this month.  So, we nerding out
  until 2am! Come early to hear space-speakers and the interstitial stylings
  of space soul funk, and stay late for space activities, a out-of-this-world
  DJ, dancing and trivia.  Wear your best space-age garb and be set to
  celebrate cosmic style!

Nerd Nite is a monthly event held in more than 75 cities across the globe
during which several folks give 18-21-minute fun-yet-informative
presentations across all disciplines – while the audience drinks along.
Despite our similar names the Nerd Guide DC and Nerd Nite DC are
unaffiliated but kindred spirits. Doors open at 6:00, show starts
at 6:30. Tickets can be purchased at [dcnine.com](http://dcnine.com).
More information available at the [Nerd Nite DC](https://dc.nerdnite.com) website.
This is a 21+ event.

#### From the Crowd to the Cloud: How Anyone Can Experience the Northern Light

By Liz MacDonald

What are the Northern Lights and how do you know when is the best time to
see them? You will be introduced to the beautiful basics of the physics
that cause the aurora borealis and how scientists are using both satellite
data and crowd-sourced social media (like the cool aurorasaurus.org app)
to figure out where and when they are best seen. At this talk, we’ll discuss
this new technology, as well as well as learn about the Sun, magnetic fields,
and glitter (!) by putting the Northern Lights in the spotlight.

Bio: Dr. Liz MacDonald (@spaceyliz) has been studying the glitter of the
Northern Lights for nearly 20 years, and it never ceases to amaze her.
She is the founder of the Aurorasaurus project (@tweetaurora) and works at
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. She has also led teams that build
instruments to measure charged particles in the space environment for
NASA and DOE missions. Outside of work, she enjoys skiing, pale ale, and poetry.

#### Is There Life in Our Galaxy?

By Joel Green

The Space Race between the USSR and the USA gave hope of peace and unity on
other worlds to a planet divided under the threat of nuclear war. No matter
where one was on the planet, one could look up into the same night sky and
see the same countless stars and potential worlds to explore.  A look at our
own solar system though shows us that not all planets are friendly to
life. So maybe despite all those worlds, we really are alone? We’ll talk
about the likelihood of life, where it may be, and discuss how space
agencies (like NASA, the Space Telescope Science Institute, and others)
are trying to find it.

Bio: Dr. Joel Green is the project scientist in the Office of Public
Outreach at the Space Telescope Science Institute, the command center
for the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope, and the home of the
beautiful imagery and science for the Hubble Space Telescope. 
He is a Nerd Nite veteran, having spoken 5 times at three different
locales, and is co-boss of Nerd Nite Baltimore.  Originally a
New Yorker, he spent six years in the wilds of Texas enjoying BBQ,
sunshine, and cowboy boots, affectations he has maintained in Baltimore.

#### COMING SOON

By Dan Kocevski

Bio: Daniel Kocevski is an astrophysicist at NASA’s Goddard Space
Flight Center where he works on understanding the transient
high-energy Universe.  He received his undergrad degree at University
of Michigan, before heading to Rice University in Houston to obtain
a PhD in astrophysics, followed by postdoctoral work at Berkeley
and Stanford, before coming to DC to work at NASA. In his free
time, he’s an avid hiker, climber, and photographer.
