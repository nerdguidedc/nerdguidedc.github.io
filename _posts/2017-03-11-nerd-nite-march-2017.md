### Women's History Month ###

What does Women’s History Month mean to you?  Well it looks like around here,
girls just want to have fun. And fundamental rights, of course. And this is
nothing new. So we’ll take a look at how ghosts helped women sound the call of
“We Can Do It!” followed up by swinging some physics facts around the dance
floor and finishing the night with our favorite JK Rowling fiction, read through
rebellious coke bottle glasses. So this Saturday Nite, for one night only,
Women’s History Month is gonna be there and be square set to a swinging beat!

***Victorian Feminist Ghost Stories: The Women’s Movement and the Science of Spiritualism by Ellery Weil***

At the turn of the twentieth century, the women’s movement was in full swing
when Victorian feminists formed an unlikely alliance with...ghosts. The
spiritualist movement, part religion, part scientific experiment, found kindred
“spirits” in Victorian feminists, as historian Ellery Weil will explain. See how
the fight for women’s rights and the quest to contact the spirits supported each
other, and how both movements shaped the landscape from Lansing, Michigan to
London, England.

Ellery Weil is a historian, writer, and DC native. She has published articles
about romance novels, sharks, and the legalities of fireworks, among other
things, and recently returned to DC after receiving her MA in History at
University College London.

***The Physics of Swing Dancing by Lily Matini and Kevin Crandell***

Swing dancing is an African American vernacular dance tradition that takes its
roots from the Western African diaspora to the birth of jazz stateside.  It’s a
street dance with raw energy and style of improvisation unlike any other
partnered or social dance.  The counterbalance, extension and compression that
allows dancers to move together as one is usually understood viscerally after
years of practice–but of course we can also understand those same principles
through physics!  Join us as we explore and demonstrate how ideas like
“conservation of energy” and “angular momentum” apply directly to our favorite
art form – and how swing makes it easier for women to take the lead!

Lily Matini majored in Law and minored in Theater & Dance at Oberlin College in
Ohio, where she was first exposed to live swing dancing.  While there, she
co-founded and ran the Oberlin Swing Society.  Currently she works for the
federal government as an IT procurement specialist and analyst. She is also an
internationally ranked swing competitor and has performed on TV, film, music
videos, corporate engagements as well as local fun-filled crowds in the DMV with
her dance team, fidgetyfeet.com. She teaches beginner/intermediate swing with
Kevin every Sunday at the Hill Center in Capitol Hill.

Kevin studied classics at St. John’s College in Annapolis, where he was first
exposed to swing dancing. He then moved on to do his graduate work in physics at
Penn State University.  He joined the “Swing Club” at PSU and has been dancing
ever since. Currently, he teaches and tutors students of all ages in physics and
other mathematical and scientific disciplines. In addition to performing with
the Fidgety Feet dance team, Kevin teaches with fellow teammate Lily Matini. If
after this demo, you want to give swing a whirl, more info can be found at the
gottaswing.com website about classes.

***R for Resistance: Fictional Rebellions in Geek Culture by Lauren McGrath***

We’ve all seen the memes and think pieces comparing Betsy DeVos to Umbridge and
The Hunger Games to late stage capitalism, but before we break out our Guy
Fawkes masks, let’s ask ourselves: how effective have fictional attempts at
resistance been? From the underground organizations in Harry Potter to the Rebel
Alliance in Star Wars, we’ll take a look at what worked, what didn’t, and how to
adapt the tools found in their rebel movements to the new world we live in.

Lauren McGrath has worn many hats over the last few years but her only real
qualifications for this talk is an overly-analytical read of Harry Potter back
in high school. Lauren has been a contributor to online magazine such as XOJane,
The Frisky, Vegan Feminist Network, and Literally Darling. Her greatest
accomplishment to date is being a bartender at Nerd Nite’s very own DC9
Nightclub, and she kindly reminds you to tip whoever it is slinging drinks in
the back!
