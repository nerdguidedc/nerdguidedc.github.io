AFI has announced its collaboration with the White House on the third annual
White House Student Film Festival, to be held in late summer 2016.
Participant Media, a global entertainment company focused on inspiring
social change, joins AFI in support of their work with young filmmakers
of the White House Student Film Festival for a second year. Open to K-12
student filmmakers, the theme of this year’s festival is “The World I Want
to Live In.” Young storytellers are now encouraged to submit their short films
based on this theme at [WhiteHouse.Gov/FilmFest](https://whitehouse.gov/filmfest).

“For nearly 50 years, the American Film Institute has served the nation by
upholding and advancing the art of filmmaking," said Bob Gazzale, AFI
President and CEO. "We began in the White House Rose Garden, and since
that day have trained thousands of filmmakers whose stories have graced
screens throughout the world. Working with the White House, we are honored
to encourage and help the youngest of storytellers bring their voices to
the art form.”

Since the festival began in 2014, AFI has worked on President Barack
Obama’s program as an advisor and producer, reviewing submissions and
creating a two-day celebration that includes educational opportunities
for the selected young filmmakers. This year, that partnership continues
as the White House Student Film Festival highlights both the
Administration’s commitment to public service and AFI's ongoing mission
to nurture the next generation of storytellers.
