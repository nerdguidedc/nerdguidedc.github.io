excerpt: >
  Supernovae are cosmic explosions where a single star can become as bright as a
  billion stars combined. Even though supernovae are crucial to the Universe,
  including producing the elements necessary for life, many mysteries remain.
  What powers them? Which stars are exploding? How do stars die? Astrophysicists
  are combining clues from observations with theoretical modeling to finally
  address these issues. And just like with any good mystery, often the answers
  lead to even more questions. Tony Piro at the Carnegie Institute on April 3.

Since 1991, the Carnegie Institution has hosted extraordinary
researchers from a wide range of scientific disciplines as part
of the Capital Science Evenings lecture series. The lectures
provide a unique opportunity to connect with some of the most
gifted investigators in science and hear the stories behind
their discoveries.

All lectures are free and open to the public.
These hour-long lectures, followed by a brief
question and answer period, go beyond the media accounts for a
firsthand look at the “ah-ha” moments, the setbacks, and the triumphs
that drive brilliant minds and fundamentally change our understanding
of the world around us.

Registration is required. You can [register online](https://carnegiescience.edu/events/lectures/dr-tony-piro-unraveling-mysteries-exploding-stars).

#### Unraveling The Mysteries of Exploding Stars

Supernovae are cosmic explosions where a single star can become as bright as a
billion stars combined. Even though supernovae are crucial to the Universe,
including producing the elements necessary for life, many mysteries remain. What
powers them? Which stars are exploding? How do stars die? Astrophysicists are
combining clues from observations with theoretical modeling to finally address
these issues. And just like with any good mystery, often the answers lead to
even more questions.
