Join Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory scientists for an exciting look at
the hottest new mission at NASA, due to launch in August 2018: the Solar Probe
Plus. This satellite will go closer to the Sun than any other man-made object
and will be the fastest one to date to collect scientific data at our nearest
star. The presentation will describe the special features of this spacecraft,
explain why scientists are interested in going so close to the Sun, and show
the Sun-diving path of the mission. Learn about the human ingenuity involved in
constructing a satellite that can survive such an extreme trip, and discover
just how long ago scientists set their sights on visiting the Sun.

The event is free and open to the public but [advance
tickets](https://airandspace.si.edu/events/solar-probe-plus-mission-touch-sun)
are required.

Following the lecture: 6:30 â€“ 8:30 pm Stargazing at the Phoebe Waterman Haas
Public Observatory.
