Second term Governor John Hickenlooper will give a special talk
about efforts in Colorado to address a rise in cyber threats
while also driving innovation and creating jobs. As Federal
support for cyber incidents begins to focus on the most
high-level targets, leaving states and their businesses and
non-profits to fend for themselves in the event of a breach,
new solutions are necessary.

The Governor will describe his state's initiatives, including
a new National Cyber Intelligence Center, which will provide
training, incident response and serve as a resource for business,
non-government organizations, and Colorado government officials.
Why does it matter and what will it do?

This event is free and open to the public but [registration is
required](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/cybersecurity-innovation-its-the-states-stupid).
