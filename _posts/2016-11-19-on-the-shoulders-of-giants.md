This phrase appears over and over again in historic texts, perhaps mostly
famously by Sir Isaac Newton in 1676: "If I have seen further it is by standing
on the shoulders [sic] of Giants." Possibly, Sir Isaac was referring to a 12th
century scholar, who wrote, "...we are dwarfs astride the shoulders of giants.
We master their wisdom and move beyond it." - from the works of the Jewish
tosaphist Isaiah di Trani (c. 1180 - c. 1250)

The question we have asked our panel of science historians to discuss is who
among the many prominent astronomers of the 20th century are the "giants" upon
whose shoulders we are now standing. It's not an easy question to answer. For
one thing, the 20th century was possibly the most explosive ever in terms of new
discoveries, advancing technologies, and the sheer numbers of important
scientists. In addition, all present day adults were born during the 20th
century, which means we are all actually embedded in the events being discussed.
Historical significance is something that becomes clearer over time. What we're
really asking our panelists is to speculate on is who we will recognize in the
future were the giants of 20th century astronomy.

While it is a challenging question, our panelists are exceptionally well
qualified to address it.

Dr. Sethanne Howard is a professional astronomer recently retired from the US
Naval Observatory where she was the Chief of the Nautical Almanac Office. She is
a well-known speaker on the subject of "4000 years of women in science", editor
of the Journal of the Washington Academy of Sciences, and secretary of the
American Astronomical Society Division on Dynamical Astronomy.

Dr. Steven Dick is also an astronomer and earned his Ph.D. in the history of
science. He served for 24 years as an astronomer and historian of the US Naval
Observatory, followed by 6 years as NASA Chief Historian. He currently holds the
Baruch S. Blumberg NASA/Library of Congress Chair in Astrobiology.

Dr. David DeVorkin is senior curator of history of astronomy and the space
sciences at the Smithsonian's National Air & Space Museum. DeVorkin's major
research interests are in the origins and development of modern astrophysics
during the 20th Century and the origins and development of the space sciences
from the V-2 rocket to the present. Panel discussion will last about an hour.
Target Audience: High school students and adults.

Tickets are $5 a person and are [available for purchase online](https://friendsoftheplanetarium.org/event/155/).
