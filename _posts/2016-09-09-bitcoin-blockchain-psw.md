excerpt: >
  On Sep 9 Arvind Narayanan will provide an accessible introduction to Bitcoin
  and the blockchain. We will trace their development to the history of
  activist movements advocating privacy and civil liberties through
  cryptographic technology. Through this we will appreciate the true potential
  of crypto-currencies, as well as their limits. We will see past the hype and
  use Bitcoin as a case study of how technology rearranges power.

The [Philosophical Society of Washington](http://www.philsoc.org/)
Lectures are selected to
appeal to those with a general interest in science and do not require
a specialized knowledge of the subject. They always contain
information that is current, explanations that are understandable
and a few controversial issues to be challenged by a critical
listener. The series is designed as much as possible to include a
wide range of disciplines.

The meetings are open to the public, free, and no reservations are
required. Dress is informal. Meetings are followed by lively
conversation. All must exit the Cosmos Club at 10:30 p.m.
Conversations are continued at another location.

The digital currency Bitcoin and its underlying technology, the blockchain, have
taken the world by storm. Supporters claim that they will fundamentally reshape
payments, economics, and even politics around the world. Skeptics say that they
are a haven for fraud and will suffer an inevitable and spectacular collapse.

This talk will provide an accessible introduction to Bitcoin and the blockchain.
We will trace their development to the history of activist movements advocating
privacy and civil liberties through cryptographic technology. Through this we
will appreciate the true potential of crypto-currencies, as well as their
limits. We will see past the hype and use Bitcoin as a case study of how
technology rearranges power.

Arvind Narayanan is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Princeton. He
also is an Affiliated Faculty Member of the Princeton Center for IT Policy and
holds an appointment as affiliate scholar of the Center for Internet and Society
at Stanford Law School.

Arvind leads a research group at Princeton studying the security, anonymity, and
stability of Bitcoin and other blockchain technologies. He also leads the Web
Transparency and Accountability project at Princeton studying how companies
collect and use personal information.

Arvind's doctoral research showed that widely used data anonymization methods
are broken in fundamental ways. He received the 2008 Privacy Enhancing
Technologies Award for this work. He is the lead author of a textbook on Bitcoin
and cryptocurrencies. He teaches a Massive Open Online Course on the same topic,
which had 35,000 students in its first iteration. He is the recipient of the
first U.S. government funding for research on cryptocurrencies. His work has
been covered in numerous journals and publications, including NPR and BBC News.
Arvind earned his PhD at the University of Texas at Austin and did postdoctoral
work at Stanford University.

The John Wesley Powell Auditorium is adjacent to the Cosmos Club, 2170 Florida
Avenue NW, Washington DC 20008. Entrance is through the club gate, the first
right-hand entrance on Florida Avenue north of the intersection with
Massachusetts Avenue NW. The auditorium entrance is to the left of the gate.
