The [National Math Festival](http://www.nationalmathfestival.org/) brings
together some of the most influential mathematicians of our time to inspire and
challenge participants to see math in new and exciting ways. Through a day of
lectures, hands-on demonstrations, art, films, performances, puzzles, games,
children’s book readings, and more, we bring out unexpected sides of mathematics
for everyone, from toddlers to adults of all ages.

The National Math Festival is free and open to the public! For those math lovers
that want early access to events with limited seating, individual and family
memberships will be available starting in early 2017, but preregistration is not
required. Over 20,000 people attended the first National Math Festival in 2015.
