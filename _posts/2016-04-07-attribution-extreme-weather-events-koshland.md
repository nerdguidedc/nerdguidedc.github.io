Don't miss the chance to learn about *Attribution of Extreme Weather Events
in the Context of Climate Change*, a new consensus report from the National
Academy of Sciences that examines the current state of the science of
attribution of extreme weather events to human-caused climate change
and natural variability. The report considers different attribution
approaches and different extreme event types, and identifies future research
priorities.
 
Hear about the report from the Chair of the authoring committee, David Titley
of the Pennsylvania State University, and committee member Adam Sobel of
Columbia University. Remarks and orchestrated Q&A will be followed by open
audience Q&A, moderated by Climate Central's Heidi Cullen and Science Writer
Seth Borenstein from the Associated Press.

The event is free and open to the public but [registration is required](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/extreme-weather-and-climate-change-tickets-23456077760).
