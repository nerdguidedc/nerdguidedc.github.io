Science surrounds us. Even when we don't notice it, science touches
almost every part of our lives. Join the
[Koshland Science Museum](https://www.koshland-science-museum.org/)
for a special event with [Story Collider](http://www.storycollider.org/),
a live storytelling project and podcast that believes that everyone has
a story to tell about science.

Listen to stories from this year’s [Mirzayan Science & Technology
Policy Fellows](http://sites.nationalacademies.org/pga/policyfellows/)
about amazing moments when science propelled a
dramatic change in their lives. From humorous stories to heartfelt
narratives, you will leave with a deeper understanding of how science
affects our lives and our communities. This cabaret-style storytelling
event will be recorded and available by podcast on the Story Collider
and museum websites.

Tickets are $7 ($5 for students and fellows) and include complimentary
refreshments.
[Advance ticket purchase](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/story-collider-tickets-19933978065)
is recommended as last year’s event sold out.

Ticketholders are encouraged to arrive 15-20 minutes before a program
begins as seating is unassigned and is available on a first-come,
first served basis. Unused and unclaimed tickets will be sold
5 minutes before the beginning of a program to individuals who are
waiting onsite. Refunds cannot be issued to the original ticketholders.
 
If one person purchases tickets for a group, that person should
provide the names of all individuals in his/her group. Those
individuals may then pick up their tickets and enter upon arrival,
space permitting.
