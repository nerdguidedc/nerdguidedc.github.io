Jupiter's moon Europa may have an internal ocean of liquid water, plus the
chemistry and energy life needs to exist.  Robert Pappalardo, Europa Mission
project scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, will discuss NASA's
plans to send a robotic mission to evaluate Europa's potential for life and
address one of humanity's most fundamental questions: Are we alone in the
universe?

The event is free and open to the public but
[advance tickets](http://airandspace.si.edu/events/tickets)
are required.

### Exploring Space Lecture Series

**Life in the Solar System and Beyond**

Exploration of our solar system has revealed a great diversity of
worlds and a variety of unexpected environments. Could they support
simple life? Candidate locations include an ocean of water under
Europa's frigid crust and subsurface regions of Enceladus that have
been tantalizingly revealed by active geysers. New technologies are
enabling the search for worlds with habitable environments beyond
the solar system as well, and on our own planet, extreme environments
where life exists can be studied as planetary analogs. In this
series, four distinguished speakers will describe the latest
developments as we look for life in a lot of strange places.
Exploring Space lectures are suitable for ages 11 and up.
