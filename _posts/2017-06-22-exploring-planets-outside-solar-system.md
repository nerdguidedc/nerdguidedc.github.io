  In this Exploring Space lecture on June 22, Caltech astronomer Heather Knutson
  will describe ongoing efforts to understand planets outside our solar system.

---

The past decade has marked a period of great progress in the quest to understand
planets outside our solar system.  The first ones discovered were enormous.
Observations of eclipsing systems, in which the planet periodically passes in
front of and then behind its star as seen from Earth, have given us new insight
into the nature of these alien worlds.  Explore these unfamiliar planets as
California Institute of Technology assistant professor of planetary science
Heather Knutson describes ongoing efforts to understand their compositions,
temperatures, and weather patterns using both ground- and space-based
telescopes.

The event is free and open to the public but
[advance tickets](https://airandspace.si.edu/event-series/exploring-space-lectures)
are required.

### Exploring Space Lecture Series ###

**Giants of the Solar System and Beyond**

Giant planets in our solar system lie beyond the asteroid belt. The Juno
spacecraft has recently arrived at the largest, Jupiter. Cassini will soon end
its mission at Saturn. Farther afield, tantalizing clues suggest the existence
of Planet Nine, a rocky world ten times the mass of Earth. And immense worlds
called Super-Earths and Hot Jupiters orbit stars other than our own. Join four
distinguished speakers as they explore the unimaginably huge, stunningly
beautiful, and sometimes bizarre giant worlds.
