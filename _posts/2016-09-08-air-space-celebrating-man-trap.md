Join Museum experts and special guests as we commemorate the moment of the 50th
anniversary of Star Trek, with a discussion on the first episode aired in 1966.
Celebrations will be held concurrently in the IMAX theaters at our Washington,
DC location and Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, VA. The evening will
be introduced live in Washington and by simulcast to Chantilly by Margaret
Weitekamp, the museum’s curator of social and cultural dimensions of
spaceflight, Rod Roddenberry, son of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, and
Bjo and John Trimble, two of Star Trek’s founding fans.

Free tickets are required, and can be [requested
online](https://airandspace.si.edu/events/screening-man-trap).

This event is part of a three-night celebration of Star Trek's 50th
anniversary, including the [Boldly Go 50 Celebration](/event/air-space-boldly-go-50-celebration.html) on September 9 and
a [21-and-over program](/event/museum-moonshine-star-trek.html) on September 10.
