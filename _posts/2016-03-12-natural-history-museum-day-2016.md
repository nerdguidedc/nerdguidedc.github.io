Join us at the
[National Museum of Natural History](
http://naturalhistory.si.edu/calendar.asp?trumbaEmbed=view%3Devent%26eventid%3D118022046)
as we celebrate girls and women in science, part of a "special edition"
of Smithsonian's signature "Museum Day Live!" event happening at
museums across the United States.

* Come meet our Youth Engagement through Science! (YES!) teen interns,
who will be sharing fun science activities they designed at the museum.
Learn about their work behind-the-scenes and find out about other
opportunities for teens to get involved!
* Stop at our Design table, where you can try an activity that brings
art and science together, and sign up to help prototype future
activities for a summer workshop.
* Talk to outstanding female scientists and experts, with programming 
throughout the day:

10:00 am - 12:00 pm         

* Evolutionary biologist Noor White will share her research on the
evolution of night vision and the origins of nocturnality in birds.
* Take a new look at teeth, as Dr. Kate McGrath demonstrates how teeth
grow like trees and record any episodes of stress in their rings.
Find out why these stress lines are important to our understanding of
the lives of human ancestors.

12:00 pm - 2:00 pm

* Clams, oysters, mussels, scallops and other species are important for
many aspects of human life, including fishing and food sources,
ecosystem clean-up, and even biomedical applications.  They are also a
huge part of the fossil record and can tell us a lot about evolutionary
processes. Come explore bivalve genomics and evolution with expert
Dr. Vanessa L. Gonzalez.
* Sea squirts: find out what they look like and how they are related to
you and talk with museum specialist Linda Cole about her research with
these soft, sac-like marine animals.

2:00 pm - 4:00 pm

* Paleoanthropologist Dr. Briana Pobiner will reveal how we can learn
about what our early ancestors ate from studying butchery marks on
modern and fossil bones left by stone tool butchery and tooth marks
left by carnivore chewing.
* With some 800 languages still spoken today, Latin America is one of
the most linguistically diverse areas of the world. Explore this
linguistic diversity with Smithsonian curator of linguistics
Dr. Gabriela Pérez Báez, who is working to document the Diidxazá
language and local environmental knowledge of southern Mexico.

Scientists from the Natural History Museum will also be participating
in career roundtable sessions at the Smithsonian Castle.
