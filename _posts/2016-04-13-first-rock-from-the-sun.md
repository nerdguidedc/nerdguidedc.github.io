excerpt: >
  The Messenger spacecraft, the first to orbit the planet Mercury,
  overcame many technical challenges to survive the harsh environment
  of the inner solar system. Along the way, the mission's discoveries
  about one of our nearest planetary neighbors have changed our
  understanding of how the inner planets – including Earth – formed
  and evolved.

Since 1991, the Carnegie Institution has hosted extraordinary
researchers from a wide range of scientific disciplines as part
of the Capital Science Evenings lecture series. The lectures
provide a unique opportunity to connect with some of the most
gifted investigators in science and hear the stories behind
their discoveries.

All lectures are free and open to the public, and begin at 6:45 PM
at the Carnegie Institute for Science.
These hour-long lectures, followed by a brief
question and answer period, go beyond the media accounts for a
firsthand look at the “ah-ha” moments, the setbacks, and the triumphs
that drive brilliant minds and fundamentally change our understanding
of the world around us.
 
Registration is required. You can [register online](https://carnegiescience.edu/events/lectures/dr-sean-solomon-first-rock-sun-exploring-mercury-spacecraft) or call the
