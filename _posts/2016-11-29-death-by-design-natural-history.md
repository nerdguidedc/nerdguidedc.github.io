Natural History on the Big Screen introduces audiences to some of the latest
environmental films that address the relationship humans have with the planet.
The "Stories From a Transforming World" three part series presented with the
Environmental Film Festival in the Nation's Capital and curated by Joshua
Bell, Curator of Globalization at the National Museum of Natural History, will
explore multiple perspectives on the Age of Man - from close to home, to a
global scale.

Death by Design, a feature length documentary, explores this question and
uncovers a global story of damaged lives, environmental destruction and devices
that are designed to die.

Consumers love – and live on – their smartphones, tablets and laptops. A cascade
of new devices pours endlessly into the market, promising even better
communication, non-stop entertainment and instant information. The numbers are
staggering. By 2020, four billion people will have a personal computer. Five
billion will own a mobile phone.

But this revolution has a dark side, hidden from most consumers. In an
investigation that spans the globe, filmmaker Sue Williams investigates the
underbelly of the electronics industry and reveals how even the smallest devices
have deadly environmental and health costs. From the intensely secretive
factories in China, to a ravaged New York community and the high tech corridors
of Silicon Valley, the film tells a story of environmental degradation, of
health tragedies, and the fast approaching tipping point between consumerism and
sustainability.

The event is free and open to the public but [advance registration is
required](http://go.si.edu/site/Calendar/392493667). Seating
is limited.
