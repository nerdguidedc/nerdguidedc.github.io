excerpt: >
  In this Exploring Space Lecture on March 23, Carolyn Porco will discuss what
  we learned from the Cassini orbiter and what its final legacy is likely to be.

---

Entering Saturnâ€™s orbit in 2004, the Cassini orbiter has returned years of
insights on this scientifically rich planetary system.  On September 15, 2017,
its mission will end and the spacecraft will be sent plunging into Saturn.
Carolyn Porco, principal investigator for the Cassini imaging system, will
present a retrospective look at what we have learned from Cassini and what its
final legacy is likely to be.

The event is free and open to the public but
[advance tickets](https://airandspace.si.edu/event-series/exploring-space-lectures)
are required.

### Exploring Space Lecture Series ###

**Giants of the Solar System and Beyond**

Giant planets in our solar system lie beyond the asteroid belt. The Juno
spacecraft has recently arrived at the largest, Jupiter. Cassini will soon end
its mission at Saturn. Farther afield, tantalizing clues suggest the existence
of Planet Nine, a rocky world ten times the mass of Earth. And immense worlds
called Super-Earths and Hot Jupiters orbit stars other than our own. Join four
distinguished speakers as they explore the unimaginably huge, stunningly
beautiful, and sometimes bizarre giant worlds.
