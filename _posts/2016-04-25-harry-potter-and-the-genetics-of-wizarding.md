More on Dr. Eric Spana:

Dr. Eric Spana is an award-winning instructor who has spent over 20 years
utilizing Drosophila as a model system for neurobiology, cell biology and
genetics. As an Assistant Professor of the Practice in Biology his primary
focus is on undergraduate teaching and research rather than graduate or
post-doctoral training. His current work focuses on helping undergraduate
students do biological laboratory research before they even begin college,
and on creating courses that allow students to contribute to real scientific
problems rather than simply following a lab manual. In class, students learn
better by being able to place new information in context with ideas they
already find familiar and understand. Dr. Spana frequently helps students
place this new information into their encyclopedic knowledge of particular
pieces of culture, like *Harry Potter*, *Star Wars*, and *The Avengers*.
