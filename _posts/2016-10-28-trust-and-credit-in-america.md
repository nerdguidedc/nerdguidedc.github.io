Sociologist Bruce G. Carruthers will discuss how credit and credit
decision-making in the United States has developed over the 19th, 20th and 21st
centuries, in the annual Maguire Lecture at the Library of Congress on Oct. 28.

Carruthers, who held the Cary and Ann Maguire Chair in Ethics and American
History at the Library’s John W. Kluge Center in 2016, will present "The
Economy of Promises: Trust and Credit in America," at 3 p.m. on Friday, Oct.
28, in the Whittall Pavilion on the ground floor of the Library’s Thomas
Jefferson Building, 10 First St. S.E., Washington, D.C. The event is free and
open to the public. Tickets are not needed.

In his lecture, Carruthers will examine how the automated credit scores and
credit-rating systems of today have evolved from older methods that depended on
individual reputations and personal relationships. He will also investigate
how, in an economy that depends on credit, people manage trust and how they
reduce uncertainty and vulnerability. The talk will be the culmination of three
months of research on the topic as the Maguire Chair at the Library of
Congress. Carruthers used the Library’s collections to research the project for
an upcoming book tentatively titled "An Economy of Promises: Trust and Credit
in America."

A sociologist of economy and law, Carruthers is the John D. MacArthur Chair and
Professor of Sociology and director of the Buffett Institute for Global Studies
at Northwestern University. He is the author or co-author of five books on
markets, business, the economy and politics. His most recent book, "Money and
Credit: A Sociological Approach," examined the social dimensions of money and
credit and the individual and corporate levels. His 2009 book "Bankrupt: Global
Lawmaking and Systemic Financial Crisis," co-authored with Terence C. Halliday,
studied how global actors have shaped corporate bankruptcy laws around the
world.
