Space junk has moved in and out of the cultural spotlight in recent years,
as falling satellites, close calls with the International Space Station,
and even a major Hollywood film all point to the possibility that humankind
has critically junked up our cosmic neighborhood. But what is space junk,
exactly, and should you be worried about it? Join historian Lisa Ruth
Rand as she discusses past and current orbital debris research, specifies
some American and international efforts to reduce debris, shares some of
the latest proposed methods to clean up orbit - from lasers to space nets
- and weighs in on how we might best solve the problem of trash in space.
The event is part of the Air and Space Museum's
[What's New in Aerospace](http://airandspace.si.edu/explore-and-learn/whats-new-aerospace/) lecture series.
