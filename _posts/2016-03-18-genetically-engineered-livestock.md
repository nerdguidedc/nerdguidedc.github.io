The [Philosophical Society of Washington](http://www.philsoc.org/)
Lectures are selected to
appeal to those with a general interest in science and do not require
a specialized knowledge of the subject. They always contain
information that is current, explanations that are understandable
and a few controversial issues to be challenged by a critical 
listener. The series is designed as much as possible to include a
wide range of disciplines.

The meetings are open to the public, free, and no reservations are
required. Dress is informal. Meetings are followed by lively
conversation. All must exit the Cosmos Club at 10:30 p.m.
Conversations are continued at another location.

#### Genetically Engineered Livestock: Bringing 21st Century Medicines to the Developing World

The production of biopharmaceuticals in the milk of genetically
engineered livestock enables a more than 200-fold increase in
productivity over current methods of culturing animal cells in
stainless steel bioreactors. This is due to the secretory architecture
of the mammary gland and its sophisticated biochemistry for protein
modification.

The genetic engineering of livestock began in the 1980s when it was
shown that recombinant DNA microinjected into mouse embryos could be
integrated into chromosomes by a natural gene repair process.
“Transgenes” were then designed to express recombinant proteins in
mice and, more productively, in other animals. Some researchers
focused particularly on expressing the proteins in the milk of
transgenic animals, hoping that they would serve as prodigious,
self-replicating “bioreactors”. Other researchers focused on methods
for cloning transgenic animals, a notable effort being the production
of the sheep "Dolly". Despite many advances, however, achieving low
cost transgenic protein production has proven far more difficult than
initially anticipated.

Recent advances in genome editing and cloning techniques have overcome
some of the obstacles. Transgene "integration" frequencies have been
increased from a few per cent to 30% - 100%, simplifying production,
reducing cost, and broadening the scope of feasible projects. For
example, the pig mammary gland recently has been engineered to better
perform the intracellular modifications needed to make very complicated
proteins, such as anti-hemophilia Factor IX. Cows have been engineered
with a balanced array of three full length gene to make human
fibrinogen, which is difficult and expensive to make by conventional
methods, especially in the amounts required to manufacture affordable
surgical tissue sealants. Only 300 of these cows can produce a metric
ton of fibrinogen, enough for large scale commercial production.

Producing proteins in the milk of transgenic livestock can be one
tenth as expensive as convention methods for manufacturing
biotherapeutics, and he capital investment required to develop
transgenic production capacity can be one billion dollars or more
below that required for a stainless steel cell culture production
facility. The lower capital requirements are particularly important
in the developing world where capital often is scarce. Furthermore,
the reduced production cost makes it feasible to economically produce
large volume biotherapeutics, such as monoclonal antibodies to treat
cancer, and fibrinogen to treat exsanguinating trauma, even in
developing economies. These advantages and USFDA/ EMEA approval of
Atryn, a regulatory coagulation protein made in the milk of
transgenic goats, have catalyzed developing countries, such as Brazil
and China, to develop biopharmaceutical manufacturing in the milk of
transgenic livestock to meet their needs for biopharmaceutical proteins.

This lecture will discuss genetic engineering of livestock animals,
particularly for producing biopharmaceutical proteins in milk, and
the promise of this technology to provide low cost production of
medically important substances in the developing world.

The John Wesley Powell Auditorium is adjacent to the Cosmos Club,
2170 Florida Avenue NW, Washington DC 20008. Entrance is through 
the club gate, the first right-hand entrance on Florida Avenue north
of the intersection with Massachusetts Avenue NW. The auditorium
entrance is to the left of the gate.
