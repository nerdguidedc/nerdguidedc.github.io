Drunk Education — the event formerly known as Drunk TED Talks and described as
one of New York's ten best alt-comedy shows by Paste Magazine and as "a real
thing" by NPR's Morning Edition — comes to our nation's capital to drop drunk
knowledge. [Tickets are $12](http://www.blackcatdc.com/shows/drunk-education.html).

Talks by:  
Matt Cohen  
Osita Nwanevu  
Emma Roller

Doors at 7:30, show at 8:00.

This event used to be called Drunk TED Talks but isn't anymore for legal
reasons. (Lawyers...... hello.) But that's okay — we're working on bringing you
all sorts of fun shows in new cities, workshops, salons, and whatever other
format that could plausibly facilitate learning stuff while drinking and
hanging.
