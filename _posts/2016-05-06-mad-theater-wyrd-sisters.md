excerpt: >
  May 6 - 21 NASA Goddard's Music and Drama Club (MAD Theater) presents Terry
  Pratchett's Wyrd Sisters. Terry Pratchett takes Shakespeare’s tragedies and
  then turns them up ‘till the knob comes off. It’s all in there–a wicked duke
  and duchess, a wise fool, the ghost of the murdered king, dim soldiers,
  strolling players, a land in peril. And who stands between the Kingdom and
  destruction? Three witches: Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg and Magrat Garlick.
  Destiny is at work, but where will it all end up? Showtimes are Friday and
  Saturday at 8 PM, Sundays at 3 PM.

Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg and Magrat Garlick.
