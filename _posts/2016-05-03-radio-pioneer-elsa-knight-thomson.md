This audio evening will feature a new project about Elsa Knight Thompson
(1906-1983), the Pacifica radio pioneer who worked for many years at
KPFA-Berkeley in the 1950s and 1960s and was among the founders of the
Pacifica Radio Network. A German producer, Martina Gross, did a show
about her a few years ago that was broadcast over German public radio.
Her production won a national prize for the best radio feature about
a woman and social issues.

The fierce and controversial journalist Elsa Knight Thompson spearheaded
the political editorial department of KPFA in Berkeley for fourteen years,
the first radio station which was paid by its listeners. Her main interest
was in social outcasts who had no chance to be heard by the media. She
believed in dialogue, freedom of opinion and the fact that the most
important task of journalists is to illuminate the backgrounds of political
and social developments and to provide the public with all information
needed for the perception of their rights. KPFA covered topics like the
McCarthy processes, interviews with the Black Panthers, reports of the
Free Speech Movement in Berkeley and the growing counterculture in the USA.

Martina Gross studied German literature, journalism and sociology at
the Freie Universität Berlin. Since 1997 she has been writing features
about music, literature, female American lawyers, seniors, radio producers
and the Basque cooperative "Mondragon" for public service broadcasting
in Germany. Her broadcast "Ten seconds from now – the American radio
pioneer Elsa Knight Thompson" (DLF 2010) was awarded the 2010 Juliane
Bartel Media Award. "Lynne Stewart, an American history" (DLF 2012) was
nominated for the Liberty Award in 2013. Her latest productions were:
"We are like gods and we can be just as good – The Hippies and the
Cyberspace" (SWR, DLF 2014) and "Living radical. The British artists
Gee Vaucher and Penny Rimbaud" (DLF 2015).

Chris Koch will join Gross for the event. Koch was trained
by Elsa Knight Thompson and later became one of the guiding producers
at All Things Considered. He now teaches at Montgomery College.

The event is free and open to the public but [registration is
required](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/hear-now-listening-series-ten-seconds-from-now-tickets-24661338728).
