The National Museum of Natural History invites you to attend a special
evening with celebrated biologist and Encyclopedia of Life catalyst
E.O. Wilson.

E.O. Wilson will discuss his life and new book, *Half-Earth*, with Kirk
Johnson, Sant Director of the National Museum of Natural History. Join us
for a unique opportunity to hear Wilson's recent and thought-provoking
proposal to devote half the surface of the Earth to nature.

*Half-Earth* will be available for purchase and signing after the program.
The event is free and open to the public but [advance registration is
required](http://go.si.edu/site/Calendar?view=Detail&id=101221)
