Dava Sobel, the best-selling author and historian of science, will discuss
early efforts to chart the stars, for the Library of Congress’ annual Jay I.
Kislak Lecture in the Archaeology and History of the Early Americas, on Oct. 6.

Sobel will present "Mapping the Elusive Southern Sky" at 6:30 p.m. on Thursday,
Oct. 6, in the Coolidge Auditorium on the ground level of the Library’s Thomas
Jefferson Building, 10 First St. S.E., Washington, D.C. The lecture is free and
open to the public. Tickets are not needed.

The presentation will be the keynote speech for a two-day conference hosted by
the Library’s Geography and Map Division. "[Facts or Fictions: Debating the
Mysteries of Early Modern Science and Cartography—A Celebration of the 500th
Anniversary of Waldseemüller’s 1516 Carta
Marina](https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2016/16-142.html)" will be held on Oct. 6
and Oct. 7 in the Coolidge Auditorium. The conference is free and open to the
public.

A former New York Times science reporter, Sobel is the author of "Longitude"
and "Galileo’s Daughter" and the forthcoming "The Glass Universe: How the
Ladies of the Harvard Observatory Took the Measure of the Stars." Her new book
will be released in December 2016.

Sobel’s talk will cover the centuries-long efforts to fill in the blanks on the
earliest printed, and sparsely populated, star chart by Albrecht Dürer, dated
1515. According to Sobel, these efforts, which included the establishment of
observatories in South America and South Africa, led not only to detailed
charts of the southern stars, but also the means to measure distances across
space, enabling astronomers to appreciate the true scale of the universe. The
Dürer chart, purchased by the Library of Congress in late 2015, is part of the
collections of the Library’s Geography and Map Division.
