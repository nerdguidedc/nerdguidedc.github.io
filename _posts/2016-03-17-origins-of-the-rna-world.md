  Four pioneers of science, who have played major roles in developing

  at the Library of Congress on March 17. The scientists have conducted
  research into the RNA world—the world at the dawn of life, before DNA,
  nearly four billion years ago. They will be interviewed about their
  roles in developing key models for the origins of life, on Earth and

Four pioneers of science, who have played major roles in developing key
models for the origins of life, will be interviewed in a program at
the Library of Congress on March 17. The scientists are Nobel Prize
winner Walter Gilbert, W. Ford Doolittle, George Fox and Ray Gesteland.

Nathaniel Comfort, the NASA/Library of Congress Chair in Astrobiology
at the Library’s John W. Kluge Center, will interview the scientists.
The event, which is free and open to the public, will take place in
room 119 on the first floor of the Thomas Jefferson Building. Tickets
are not needed. The Kluge Center is sponsoring the event as part of
its joint NASA/Library of Congress Astrobiology Program.

The scientists have conducted research into the RNA world—the world 
at the dawn of life, before DNA, nearly four billion years ago.
Comfort will interview the scholars about their roles in developing
key models for the origins of life, on Earth and beyond.

The event will be structured as a witness seminar-style oral history,
where several people associated with a particular set of circumstances
or events are invited to meet together to discuss, debate, and even
disagree about their reminiscences. The format was originally developed
by the Institute of Contemporary British History at King’s College and
inaugurated by the Wellcome Trust in 1990. Audience questions will be
included.

Gilbert is a 1980 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry and a University
Professor at Harvard University. Doolittle is a professor emeritus at
Dalhousie University. Fox is a professor at the University of Houston
and Gesteland is a distinguished professor emeritus at the University
of Utah.

Comfort is a historian of recent science and a professor at the
Institute of the History of Medicine at The Johns Hopkins University.
His books include "The Science of Human Perfection: How Genes Became
the Heart of American Medicine" (2012) and "The Tangled Field:
Barbara McClintock’s Search for the Patterns of Genetic Control" (2001).
