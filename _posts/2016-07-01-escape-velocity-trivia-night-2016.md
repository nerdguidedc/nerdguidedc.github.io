We are mainly expecting Escape Velocity attendees to participate, however this
is a public event and we will not be checking for badges or wristbands. By all
means, if you want to buy tickets for the con (and it'll be awesome and chock
full of Science fact and fiction), then you can a discount code from the [Meetup
site](http://www.meetup.com/scifioutpost/events/232097781/?rv=me1).

Winning teams will receive prizes from Local Motors, our Trivia Night sponsors.
These guys are the geniuses bringing 3D printed custom cars and self-driving
vehicles to their new location on National Harbor.

No cost to enter. Teams of 4 people max each. It will be held in the Cherry
Blossom Ballroom of the Gaylord National, and we will be setting up a cash bar,
so don't be shy with the drinkies! We won't be selling food in the ballroom, but
you're welcome to bring in food from elsewhere. [Sign up on
Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/scifioutpost/events/232097781/?rv=me1) if you've
set up a team, and they'll get you guys on the sign-up list early! Signing up
early is encouraged but not mandatory, and sign-ups will get table space
priority over walk-ins.
