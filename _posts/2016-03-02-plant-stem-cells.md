excerpt: >
  Standing strong and silent, plants are all around us, both shaping
  our world and responding to it.  Plants can live for hundreds,
  if not thousands of years, continuously renewing themselves
  through active stem cells, yet also avoiding cancer. What
  lessons might we learn about our own biological potential
  from a closer look at their life strategies?

Since 1991, the Carnegie Institution has hosted extraordinary
researchers from a wide range of scientific disciplines as part
of the Capital Science Evenings lecture series. The lectures
provide a unique opportunity to connect with some of the most
gifted investigators in science and hear the stories behind
their discoveries.

All lectures are free and open to the public, and begin at 6:45 PM
at the Carnegie Institute for Science.
These hour-long lectures, followed by a brief
question and answer period, go beyond the media accounts for a
firsthand look at the “ah-ha” moments, the setbacks, and the triumphs
that drive brilliant minds and fundamentally change our understanding
of the world around us.
 
Registration is required. You can [register online](https://carnegiescience.edu/events/lectures/dr-dominique-bergmann-making-difference-how-create-stem-cells-and-have-their) or call the
