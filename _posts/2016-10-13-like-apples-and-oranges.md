Mike Canning, a film critic for the Hill Rag, will present "Novels into Films:
Like Apples and Oranges" on Thursday, Oct. 13. Maureen Corrigan, a critic for
NPR’s cultural program "Fresh Air," will present "The Not-So-Great Gatsby: How
Hollywood Misinterprets America’s Greatest Novel" on Monday, Nov. 14.

Both lectures will be held from noon to 1 p.m. in the Mary Pickford Theater on
the third floor of the James Madison Memorial Building, 101 Independence Ave.
S.E., Washington, D.C. Tickets are not required for these events, which are
free and open to the public.

Sponsored by the Library’s Humanities and Social Sciences Division and
Interpretive Programs Office, the lectures are held in conjunction with the
"America Reads" exhibition, which celebrates the public’s choice of 65 books by
American authors that had a profound effect on American life. "America Reads"
is on view in the Library’s Thomas Jefferson Building, 10 First St. S.E.,
Washington, D.C. It is free and open to the public through Dec. 31, 2016,
Monday through Saturday, from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Tickets are not required.

Canning will look at a number of American motion pictures based on major novels
by U.S. writers. He will argue that novels and cinema are two very distinct
vehicles. "The novel, particularly the novel of some literary ambition,
produces a private, discursive experience essentially made by one creator for
an audience of one. The Hollywood feature film has been, and still basically
is, a more public, visual, dominating experience produced by a multitude of
persons for a mass audience," he said.

Canning has been the regular movie reviewer for the Hill Rag newspaper on
Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. since 1993, and he is a freelance writer on
film, politics and public affairs. He also worked for 28 years as a press and
cultural officer with the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) overseas, serving in
eight countries on four continents before retiring in 1993.
