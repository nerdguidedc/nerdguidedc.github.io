The National Museum of Natural History invites you to attend a special evening
with award-winning science writer and author, Ed Yong.  Yong will take you on a
grand tour through the animal kingdom, from squids to aphids to deep-sea worms,
as he speaks about his new book, I Contain Multitudes.

In a conversation with Kirk Johnson, Sant Director of the National Museum of
Natural History, Yong will reveal how microbes build animal bodies, affect their
evolutionary opportunities, and might be manipulated.  He will make you question
everything you think you know about natural history!

I Contain Multitudes will be available for purchase and signing after the
program.

The event is free and open to the public but [advance registration is
required](http://go.si.edu/site/Calendar?view=Detail&id=101364). Seating
is limited.
