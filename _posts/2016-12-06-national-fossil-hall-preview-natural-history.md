Join us as Kirk Johnson, paleontologist, Museum Director, and the moderator of
An Evening With... series, takes us behind the scenes and explores the massive
undertaking of redoing the National Fossil Hall.

In a conversation with philanthropist David M. Rubenstein, Johnson will
illuminate current trends in paleontology, unveil new fossil discoveries
featured in the National Fossil Hall, and explore why studying the past matters
as we contemplate our planet’s future. Get a sneak peek at plans for the new
exhibition, and learn more about the role of conserving and displaying dinosaurs
at a national museum.

The event is free and open to the public but [advance registration is
required](http://go.si.edu/site/Calendar?view=Detail&id=101501&s_src=nerd_web_cal_er_text). Space is limited.
