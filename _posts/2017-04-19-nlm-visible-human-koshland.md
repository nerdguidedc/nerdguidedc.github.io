Although the term bioethics was not coined until 1926, questions surrounding
life sciences and what people should do have been around for centuries. Visiting
the National Institutes of Health National Library of Medicine (NLM) we’ll
explore The Visible Human Project exhibit and get a sneak peek at some of NLM’s
hidden treasures. Completed in 1995, the Visible Human Project raises bioethical
questions about informed consent, capital punishment, and the donation of human
remains.
