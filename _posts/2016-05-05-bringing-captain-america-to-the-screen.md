Joe and Anthony Russo entered the Marvel film universe with Captain America:
The Winter Soldier, one of the top-grossing films of 2014. The brothers
recently directed the third film in the franchise, the upcoming Captain
America: Civil War, which brings the classic storyline from the comics
to life, pitting Cap (Chris Evans) against Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.).

In conversation with NPR’s Linda Holmes, the directors discuss their
experience in translating the adventures of the iconic superhero from
the page to the screen.

Before stepping behind the camera for the Captain America series, the
Russos served as executive producers and directors for several TV series,
including Community and Happy Endings, and earned a Primetime Emmy for
directing the pilot episode of the cult hit Arrested Development. Their
film debut was 2002’s Welcome to Collinwood, produced by Steven Soderbergh
and George Clooney.
