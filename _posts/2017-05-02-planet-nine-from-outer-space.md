excerpt: >
  In this Exploring Space lecture on May 2, Caltech astronomer Mike Brown will
  explore the evidence of a possible ninth planet in the outer solar system.

---

The recent suggestion of evidence of a massive ninth planet in the outer solar
system has set off a worldwide search to find this latest member of our
planetary family. Mike Brown, professor of planetary astronomy at California
Institute of Technology and discoverer of several Kuiper Belt objects, will
explore the evidence of Planet Nine and the prospects for the search now
underway.

The event is free and open to the public but
[advance tickets](https://airandspace.si.edu/event-series/exploring-space-lectures)
are required.

### Exploring Space Lecture Series ###

**Giants of the Solar System and Beyond**

Giant planets in our solar system lie beyond the asteroid belt. The Juno
spacecraft has recently arrived at the largest, Jupiter. Cassini will soon end
its mission at Saturn. Farther afield, tantalizing clues suggest the existence
of Planet Nine, a rocky world ten times the mass of Earth. And immense worlds
called Super-Earths and Hot Jupiters orbit stars other than our own. Join four
distinguished speakers as they explore the unimaginably huge, stunningly
beautiful, and sometimes bizarre giant worlds.
