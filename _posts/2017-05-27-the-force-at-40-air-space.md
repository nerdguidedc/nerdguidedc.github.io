A long time ago (1977) in a movie theater far, far away, a film was released
that taught us the ways of the Force. We’re celebrating the 40th anniversary of
Star Wars with two special screenings of Star Wars: A New Hope in the Museum’s
Lockheed Martin IMAX Theater. Join us and other Star Wars fans for these special
screenings, along with photo opportunities with costumed characters, a brass
band celebrating the classic score, and talks with experts about the films and
their impact.

Free tickets will be required for the screenings, and will be available on
Wednesday, May 10 at 10:00 am.
