You're invited to step into the spectacular Arts and Industries Building for
[a grand party](http://smithsonianassociates.org/smithsonianat8/event/worlds-fair.aspx)
that offers a taste of world's fair history. The Smithsonian's
most beautiful (and secret) space comes to life in the spirit of fair
entertainments with music, roving performers, dancing, drinks and midway-inspired
food, games, and more.

Built as America's first national museum to permanently house the exhibits of
the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, the Arts and Industries
Building is the perfect place to celebrate the glamour, excitement,
innovations, and fun of the golden age of world’s fairs. With its soaring
arches, three-story domed rotunda, elaborate stenciling and stained glass,
and intricately patterned floors, the structure boasts one of Washington's
most splendid Gilded-Age interiors. Because of extended renovations,
the public hasn't entered this 1881 architectural treasure for 12 years.
But SMITHSONIAN at 8 is ready to take you inside!

The evening includes:

* Dancing to music by DJ Trayze
* Carnival games, trivia, and a photo booth to capture moments to share
* World's fair fare inspired by foods that debuted at these global
extravaganzas, as well as a cash bar by Tortoise and Hare
* Plenty of opportunities to take a rare close-up look at the stunning
Arts and Industries Building and its opulent decoration

Take your fashion cues from your favorite world's fair era and you
might take home a prize. Perhaps you’ll find your style in Victorian
London, site of the celebrated Crystal Palace, or elegant Belle Epoque
Paris, where the Eiffel Tower astonished visitors to the Exposition
Universelle of 1889. Or choose an all-American look that reflects
the period of the dazzling St. Louis world's fair of 1904 or the
World of Tomorrow imagined at the New York fair of 1939.

No matter what you wear, you'll enjoy saluting the fun and
the history of world's fairs—and doing it in a stunning
Smithsonian setting.

VIP ticket holders ($100 a person): Enjoy an open bar all night,
as well as exclusive early access to the event from 7 to 8 p.m.,
featuring a bar that includes specialty cocktails and small bites.

General admission tickets ($50 a person) include two complimentary
drinks and carnival snacks.
