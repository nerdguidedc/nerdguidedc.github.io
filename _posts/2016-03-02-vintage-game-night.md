Located just above Dupont Circle, the President Woodrow Wilson
House is the authentically furnished 1920s home where our 28th
President moved from the White House. Lounge where Wilson would
have lounged, play games the Wilson family would have played
(from the 1920s, 30s and 40s) and enjoy a unique game night
experience unlike anything else in DC!

The President Woodrow Wilson House will be open after hours for
this happy hour event. Ticket price includes entrance to the museum,
2 drink vouchers, gaming munchies, and all-you-can-play vintage
board games. Additional drinks can be purchased for $5.

Tickets are $15 per person and are [available for purchase](http://www.woodrowwilsonhouse.org/event/vintage-game-night-march-2-2) online.
A very limited number of tickets may be available at the door.
