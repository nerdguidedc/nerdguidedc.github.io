**HAPPINESS (2016)**  
Friday, July 15, 7 pm  

World premiere!  

In person: Kara Wai, actress; Carlos Chan, actor  

Kara Wai gives a powerful performance in the world premiere of Andy Lo’s
directorial debut. In her role as a woman suffering from Alzheimer’s, she takes
under her wing an aimless young man (Chan) who has come to Hong Kong to look for
the father who abandoned him. Together these wounded souls make a family of
their own in this touching drama from the screenwriter of Crazy n’ The City and
My Name is Fame. Followed by a Q&A and an autograph signing with its two stars.
(Dir.: Andy Lo, Hong Kong, 2016, 113 min., DCP, Cantonese with English
subtitles)

**MY YOUNG AUNTIE (1981)**  
Sunday, July 17, 2 pm  

In person: Kara Wai, actress; Carlos Chan, actor  

Kara Wai won her first Hong Kong Film Award for her effervescent performance in
this delightful kung fu comedy. She plays a young student who marries her dying
teacher to keep his inheritance away from his untrustworthy relatives. When she
visits her new relatives, traditional notions of familial hierarchy are
upended—and her dazzling kung fu skills come in handy when a bunch of bad guys
show up to steal the family property. © Licensed by Celestial Pictures Limited.

**THE MERMAID (2016)**  
Saturday, July 23, 2 pm  

3D screening!  

The Mermaid is an “exhilarating, bizarre, good-hearted, blatantly obvious
sci-fi-fantasy-slapstick eco-fable” (Glenn Kenny, New York Times) from Hong Kong
comedy king Stephen Chow (Kung Fu Hustle, Shaolin Soccer). It is also the
highest-grossing Chinese film of all time. Since it made only a brief appearance
on American screens, we’re bringing it back for an encore—in 3D, no less.

When an island development threatens their habitat, a mermaid family sends one
of its number (charming newcomer Jelly Lin) to assassinate the greedy
entrepreneur. Instead of using her sack of weaponized sea urchins to kill him,
she falls in love. Chow’s brand of absurdist humor is on full display in this
wild ride that covers all the comedy bases, from rom-com to high-flying action,
but it carries a sincere environmental message at its heart. (Dir.: Stephen
Chow, China/Hong Kong, 2016, 94 min., DCP, Mandarin with English subtitles, 3D)

**TEN YEARS (2015)**  
Sunday, July 24, 2 pm  

See the micro-budget sci-fi omnibus that beat Star Wars: The Force Awakens at
the Hong Kong box office. Chinese authorities considered Ten Years so dangerous
that they banned it from theaters and even blacked out broadcast of the Hong
Kong Film Awards simply because it was nominated.

Made for the equivalent of about $70,000, this collection of five short films,
each by a different director, speculates darkly on what Hong Kong will look like
in 2025. A false-flag assassination plot and a children’s brigade that keeps
tabs on subversive adults are among the ominous predictions. The idea for the
film germinated before the 2014 Hong Kong street protests, but all five of its
parts channel the energy and anxiety of the Umbrella Movement. (Dir.: Ng
La-leung, Jevons Au, Chow Kwun-Wai, Fei-Pang Wong, and Kwok Zune, Hong Kong,
2015, 104 min., DCP, Cantonese with Chinese and English subtitles)

**OFFICE (2015)**  
Saturday, July 30, 2 pm  

3D screening!  

According to the New York Times’ Manohla Dargis, if Johnnie To “were an
American, his name would fall from lips as easily as Martin Scorsese’s.” This
masterful director of more than fifty films, including such classics as Election
and PTU, has never applied his signature fluid camerawork to a full-blown
musical... until now.

Based on Design for Living, a popular stage play by Sylvia Chang (who stars in
the movie alongside the eternally suave Chow Yun-fat), Office depicts the ups
and downs—romantic and financial—of a financial firm’s staff during 2008’s
global economic turmoil. Full of sparkling song and dance numbers performed in
an abstract set of glass walls and tubes of light, this “visually inventive romp
...charmingly mines humor, romance and no shortage of eccentric lyrics from the
world of spreadsheets and stock portfolios” (Justin Chang, Variety). (Dir.:
Johnnie To, Hong Kong/China, 2015, 117 min., DCP, Cantonese and Mandarin with
English subtitles, 3D)

**IP MAN 3 (2015)**  
Sunday, July 31, 2 pm  

Donnie Yen versus Mike Tyson? Yes, please! In the third installment of this
popular franchise, Yen reprises his role as the real-life kung fu master best
known for having trained a young Bruce Lee (as seen here in the first of many
fight scenes choreographed by the legendary Yuen Woo-ping). In this edition,
which was nominated for eight Hong Kong Film Awards, Ip is settling into life as
a family man, but he’s soon called to protect Hong Kong from a ruthless American
businessman (with surprisingly strong boxing skills) who is trying to make a
land grab. Yen brings his customary grace and gravitas to the title role, while
director Wilson Yip suffuses the film with rich period detail. (Dir.: Wilson
Yip, Hong Kong, 2015, 105 min., DCP, Cantonese with English subtitles)

**THE BLADE (1995)**  
Saturday, August 6, 1 pm

The Blade is Tsui Hark’s masterful tribute to the martial arts films of his
youth. A reimagining of director Chang Cheh’s 1967 wuxia landmark The One-Armed
Swordsman, this phantasmagoric action film moves like an out-of-control freight
train. Featuring rapid cutting, berserk camera movement, frenetic choreography,
and compositions bursting with detail, The Blade shows one of the world's best
directors at the top of his game. Description courtesy of Subway Cinema. (Dir.:
Tsui Hark, Hong Kong, 1995, 100 min., 35mm, Cantonese with English subtitles)

**A TERRA-COTTA WARRIOR (1990)**  
Saturday, August 6, 3:30 pm  

Inspired by everyone from Kurosawa to Spielberg, A Terra-Cotta Warrior is a
feast for the senses. Two and a half years in the making, it was one of the most
exquisite fantasy films to come out of Hong Kong in the 1990s, featuring a
unique blend of romance, swashbuckling action, and comedy.  Zhang Yimou and Gong
Li—then China’s cinematic power couple—star as an imperial soldier and the woman
who brings him back to life after he’s spent centuries encased in clay in the
emperor’s tomb. Description courtesy of Subway Cinema. (Dir.: Ching Siu-tung,
Hong Kong, 1990, 97 min., 35mm, Cantonese with English subtitles)

**THE RED WOLF (1995)**  
Sunday, August 7, 2 pm  

In person: Bobby Samuels  

The first African American to be inducted into the Hong Kong Stuntman’s
Association, Bobby Samuels worked with some of Hong Kong’s biggest movie stars
during his career there in the 1990s. Join him to close out the festival with a
screening and discussion of one of his films, the action-packed hostage drama
The Red Wolf, directed by legendary stunt-master Yuen Wo-ping. (Dir.: Yuen
Wo-ping, Hong Kong, 1995, 92 min., DVD, Cantonese with English subtitles)
