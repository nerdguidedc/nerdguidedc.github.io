This is a free animation workshop for students, hobbyists, and professionals.
All ages welcome. We will be using a new 2d animation program called [OpenToonz](https://opentoonz.github.io/e/).
OpenToonz, the open source version of the Toonz animation software used by Studio
Ghibli, was released to the public on March 26, 2016.
Brush up on your skills, learn new ones, or discover the world of cartooning
for the first time. This workshop covers a range of traditional and digital
techniques used in comics and animation. Learn basic theory and mechanics
behind animation, develop observational and drawing skills, and study the
fundamental principles of story development, character design, layout and
storyboarding. 

Create a project for fun, for entry into a film festival, or to add to your portfolio. 
Come in with an existing project or start something from scratch. 
Work independently or with others to complete a cartoon and or animated short film. 
No drawing or animation experience is required.
