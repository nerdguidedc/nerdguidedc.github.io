  On May 6 three scientists will discuss the recent, historical detection of
  gravitational waves created by the stupendous collision of two black holes.
  The discussion will cover the LIGO instruments that detected the waves, the
  theoretical understanding of gravitational waves, and the cosmic events that
  can warp the fabric of space-time with sufficient magnitude to propagate
  across the universe and be detected here on Earth, and the ways in which
  these events can be detected.

The [Philosophical Society of Washington](http://www.philsoc.org/)
Lectures are selected to
appeal to those with a general interest in science and do not require
a specialized knowledge of the subject. They always contain
information that is current, explanations that are understandable
and a few controversial issues to be challenged by a critical
listener. The series is designed as much as possible to include a
wide range of disciplines.

The meetings are open to the public, free, and no reservations are
required. Dress is informal. Meetings are followed by lively
conversation. All must exit the Cosmos Club at 10:30 p.m.
Conversations are continued at another location.

Three scientists will discuss the recent, historical detection of gravitational
waves created by the stupendous collision of two black holes. The discussion
will cover the LIGO instruments that detected the waves, the theoretical
understanding of gravitational waves, and the cosmic events that can warp the
fabric of space-time with sufficient magnitude to propagate across the universe
and be detected here on Earth, and the ways in which these events can be
detected. Plans for future and more sensitive detectors will be discussed, and
how the new field of gravitational wave astronomy is likely to increase our
understanding of the universe and influence the fields of fundamental physics
and cosmology.

### The Detection of Gravitational Waves - The Very First Chirp

Peter S. Shawhan  
Associate Professor of Physics  
Department of Physics  
The University of Maryland  

The quest to detect gravitational waves -- predicted by Albert Einstein's
general theory of relativity, but dismissed by Einstein as an undetectably
small effect -- began more than 50 years ago at the University of Maryland
with modest equipment. Clever ideas, new technologies, and the patient faith
of scientists and the National Science Foundation led to the construction
of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), twin
sites with exquisitely sensitive detectors capable of measuring extremely
tiny changes in the geometry of spacetime itself. But what astrophysical
systems exist out there to produce these signals, and how rare are they?
The initial LIGO detectors worked as designed but did not yield any clear signal.

A long-awaited upgrade, Advanced LIGO, began collecting science-quality data
with even greater sensitivity in September 2015. Almost before we knew it,
the detectors captured a breathtaking signal, remarkable both in its clarity
and in what it tells us about its source. The scientific team labored in
secrecy for months to fully validate the signal and analyze its implications
before announcing it to the world on February 11. I will share an
insider's view of the science, the methods, and the findings from this
sensational event.

### The Music of General Relativity - Listening to Black Holes

John Baker  
Astrophysicist  
NASA-Goddard Space Flight Center.  

It has now been a century since Einstein published his theory of general
relativity and first described gravitational waves. Only much more recently
have we come to understand those predictions in sufficient detail to fully
interpret the first gravitational-wave observations of merging black holes.
The detailed predictions of Einstein's theory provide the foundation for
interpreting our new hearing-like sense of the universe provided by
gravitational-wave astronomy.

Black hole mergers, whether they are mergers of the collapsed cores of giant
stars or mergers of the gargantuan supermassive black holes at the centers of
galaxies, are believed to be the most powerful astronomical cataclysms. The
whirling dance of the black holes on their way to merger release as much energy
as the light from all the stars in the sky in the form of gravitational-waves.
Those waves in turn provide a detailed record of choreography of the merger
and thus also reveal the characteristics of the black holes. I will discuss
our theoretical understanding of black hole mergers and their predicted
gravitational-wave signatures. The observation of GW150914 provides our
first direct evidence of these systems and the strong gravity phenomena
involved in their mergers. This observation, though, is just our first step
toward the richer understanding of gravity and the dynamic world of dark
objects in the universe which gravitational-wave astronomy can provide.

### New Astrophysics: Observing Gravitational Waves Across the EM Spectrum

Julie McEnery  
Astrophysicist and Fermi Project Scientist  
Astrophysics Science Division  
NASA /Goddard Space Flight Center  

Gravitational wave observatories are providing us with a spectacular new window
on some of the most extreme phenomena in the Universe. To put these new
discoveries into context, we conduct coordinated observations with more
traditional telescopes from radio to gamma-ray wavebands. Gravitational
wave observations provide us with exquisite information about the nature
and geometry of the compact objects responsible for producing the gravitational
wave signal. Complementary electromagnetic observations can provide us with
information about the environment around gravitational wave sources. This is
critically important for placing gravitational wave sources within the broader
astrophysical context. In this talk, I will describe what we are looking for
and why, how we search for electromagnetic counterparts, progress to date and
future prospects.

The John Wesley Powell Auditorium is adjacent to the Cosmos Club,
2170 Florida Avenue NW, Washington DC 20008. Entrance is through
the club gate, the first right-hand entrance on Florida Avenue north
of the intersection with Massachusetts Avenue NW. The auditorium
entrance is to the left of the gate.
