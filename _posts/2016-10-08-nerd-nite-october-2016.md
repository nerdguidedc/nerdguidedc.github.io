excerpt: >
  If you thought it was scary when that one nerd kid kept hitting on you during
  math class in high school, watch out, because it gets even scarier when nerds
  do Halloween. Yes, October is here, and that’s the time of the year when Nerd
  Nite brings you tales of all things gooey, ghastly, and gruesome. So, come
  steel your nerves with a shot of bourbon or some beer, and hear our nerds
  tell tales of head transplants, flesh eating flies, lesbian vampires, and
  some crazy sexual behavior (though that talk we be admittedly less
  frightening). So, this month, it’s Nerd Nite on Saturday, October 8: Be
  there, and be scared.

Nerd Nite is a monthly event held in more than 75 cities across the globe
during which several folks give 18-21-minute fun-yet-informative
presentations across all disciplines – while the audience drinks along.
Despite our similar names the Nerd Guide DC and Nerd Nite DC are
unaffiliated but kindred spirits. Doors open at 6:00, show starts
at 6:30. Tickets are $10. More information available at the [Nerd Nite
DC](https://dc.nerdnite.com) website. This is a 21+ event.

**Human Head Transplants**

By Sam Kean

Doctors in several countries are preparing to do the ultimate in surgery,
transplant a head from one human body to another. Can they possibly succeed?
Several studies, including head transplants in animals, suggest yes. And if they
do succeed, that’s when things could really get messy. What would it be like to
wake up with a new body? Would you still feel like you? Philosophers have
debated the idea for centuries – now science might provide the answers...

Bio: Sam Kean is the New York Times bestselling author of The Dueling
Neurosurgeons, The Disappearing Spoon, and The Violinist’s Thumb. Each of his
books were named Amazon top science books of the year, and his work has been
featured on NPR’s “Radiolab,” “All Things Considered,” and “Fresh Air.”

**Our Endless War with the Screwworm Fly**

By Josh Shiode

For more than 50 years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has been waging a war
against the screwworm fly. The weapons of choice? Radioactive Cobalt, lab-raised
flies, and a putrid mix of ground meat and formaldehyde. Why are we doing this?
What does it have to do with Zika? And what the hell is a screwworm? These
questions and more, will be answered. Also, there’s a screwworm-sniffing dog.

Bio: Josh Shiode is is an astrophysicist turned science lobbyist-ish. He learned
about the screwworm fly as part of his work leading the Golden Goose Award,
which honors odd, silly, or obscure sounding government funded research that has
returned serious benefits to society. His friends are tired of hearing about it,
so he decided to bring his act to the Nerd Nite stage.

**Our Inner Ape is Human**

By Tracy Duvall

People share 98+ percent of their genome with chimps and bonobos. So which
represents our true human nature? Are we inevitably patriarchal and warlike,
like the abstemious chimps – or possibly matriarchal and peaceable, like the
randy bonobos? In short, will having sex with everyone all the time produce the
new millennium? Maybe! But studying other apes isn’t the way to answer the
question. I’ll explain why, to understand human possibilities, we should focus
on … people. Along the way, I’ll touch on the evolution, genetics, and
comparative behavior of chimps, bonobos, and humans. And in order to keep with
tonight’s theme, we’ll be showing you some examples of some truly frightening
human ape behaviors.

Bio: Tracy is an anthropologist, and world traveler who has spent much of the
past 6 years getting to observe the often inexplicable behavior of human (and
nonhuman) primates in Indonesia, Philippines, and Tanzania. He’s taught about
human evolution and primatology, hung out with chimps, told jokes on the radio
in Mexico, and published a novel titled, Bonobo!
