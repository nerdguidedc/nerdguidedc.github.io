excerpt: >
  Join Dan Sarewitz and Will Thomas, an historian of science and a policy
  analyst at the American Institute of Physics, for an historically-anchored
  discussion about what ails science and what the remedies might be, the social
  benefits we should expect from our massive investment in science, and what’s
  at stake if we ignore inconvenient truths about the present state of
  scientific inquiry. DC Science Cafe at Busboys and Poets 6:30 pm.

The scientific enterprise is a precious jewel in humanity’s narrative. It’s been
the most reliable basis for uncovering provisional truths about how the world
works, for technological innovation, and for decision-making on scales ranging
from the personal to the global. But as Dan Sarewitz, co-director of the
Consortium for Science, Policy & Outcomes at Arizona State University, sees it,
the common and long-held claim that the self-direction of science accounts for
its social benefits is a myth and has led to alarming flaws in science’s
organization, funding, and reward systems. The most important foundation of the
scientific enterprise — trust in its fundamental validity and social value — is
now at risk, he says.
