  Tell Me Something I Don’t Know is a live game show and podcast hosted by
  Stephen J. Dubner, co-author of the Freakonomics books and host of
  Freakonomics Radio. It has the same kind of factual, inquisitive journalism
  that has been a hallmark of Dubner’s work, but it’s disguised in the most
  entertaining, unexpected, and occasionally ridiculous conversation you’re
  likely to hear. Live taping at Sixth & I on March 6, 7 at 7.30 pm.

[Tell Me Something I Don’t Know](http://tmsidk.com/) is a live game show and podcast hosted by Stephen
J. Dubner, co-author of the Freakonomics books and host of Freakonomics Radio.
It has the same kind of factual, inquisitive journalism that has been a hallmark
of Dubner’s work, but it’s disguised in the most entertaining, unexpected, and
occasionally ridiculous conversation you’re likely to hear.

Three celebrity panelists listen as contestants come on stage before a live
audience and try to wow them with a fascinating fact — a historical wrinkle, a
new line of research — anything, really, as long as it’s interesting, useful,
and true (or at least true-ish). There’s even a real-time human fact-checker on
hand. The panel — an eclectic mix of comedians, brainiacs, and other smart
people — poke and prod the contestants, and ultimately choose a winner.

Tickets are $22.50 in advance, $27.50 day of show. Two shows: [March
6](https://www.sixthandi.org/event/tell-something-dont-know-podcast-live-2/) and
[March
7](https://www.sixthandi.org/event/tell-something-dont-know-podcast-live/).
