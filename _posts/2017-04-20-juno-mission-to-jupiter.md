excerpt: >
  In this Exploring Space lecture on April 20, Scott Bolton will discuss the
  Juno orbiter's mission to understand the origin and evolution of Jupiter.

---

The Juno orbiter’s mission is to understand the origin and evolution of gigantic
Jupiter.  As it orbits the planet, Juno will explore the composition and
structure of Jupiter’s dynamic atmosphere, the nature of its deepest core, and
the characteristics of its magnetosphere and bright auroras.  Scott Bolton, the
principal investigator for Juno, will guide us through the spacecraft’s journey
as it opens a window on Jupiter’s long-held secrets.

The event is free and open to the public but
[advance tickets](https://airandspace.si.edu/event-series/exploring-space-lectures)
are required.

### Exploring Space Lecture Series ###

**Giants of the Solar System and Beyond**

Giant planets in our solar system lie beyond the asteroid belt. The Juno
spacecraft has recently arrived at the largest, Jupiter. Cassini will soon end
its mission at Saturn. Farther afield, tantalizing clues suggest the existence
of Planet Nine, a rocky world ten times the mass of Earth. And immense worlds
called Super-Earths and Hot Jupiters orbit stars other than our own. Join four
distinguished speakers as they explore the unimaginably huge, stunningly
beautiful, and sometimes bizarre giant worlds.
