The Freer and Sackler Galleries along with [Otakorp](http://www.otakorp.org) will celebrate the 2016
National Cherry Blossom Festival with a day full of Japanese art,
anime and manga films, and family activities on April 16. Admission for this
event is free, but keep in mind that seating for films is available on a
first-come, first-served basis. Auditorium doors open approximately

### Miss Hokusai

**1:00 pm**

Katsushika Hokusai is one of the most famous Japanese artists. His woodblock print
*The Great Wave off Kanagawa* and series *Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji*
(both of which have been exhibited in the Freer|Sackler) are iconic the world over.
Few people know, however, that Hokusai had a talented daughter, O-ei, who
sometimes collaborated with him.

She is at the center of this award-winning film from anime master Keiichi Hara.
It tells the story of an eccentric family of artists, a troubled father-daughter
relationship, and a free-spirited woman in early nineteenth-century Japan.
Variety called the film a “stellar example of the oft-cited principle that
animation is an art form, not a genre.” (Dir.: Keiichi Hara, Japan, 2015,
90 min., Blu Ray, Japanese with English subtitles)

### From Up On Poppy Hill

**3:00 pm**

Written by the legendary founder of Studio Ghibli, Hayao Miyazaki (Spirited
Away), and directed by Goro Miyazaki, From Up on Poppy Hill marks the first
feature film collaboration between this father and son. The results are
stunning: a pure, nuanced, and heartfelt film that signals yet another
triumph for the esteemed studio.

Set in 1963, the story centers on an innocent romance between Umi and
Shun, two high-school kids caught up in the changing times. While the
children work together to save a dilapidated Meiji-era clubhouse from
demolition, their tentative relationship begins to blossom. But in an
unexpected twist—which parallels what the country itself is facing—a
buried secret emerges to cast a shadow on their future. The sense of
yearning and new possibility is palpable (the upbeat mood is set
perfectly by period pop music), evoking both wide-eyed hope for the
future and an aching nostalgia for the past. (Dir.: Goro Miyazaki,
Japan, 2011, 91 min., Blu Ray, English)

### A Letter to Momo

**5:00 pm**

From the creators of Ghost in the Shell comes a wonderfully expressive and
beautifully animated tale that combines bursts of whimsy and humor with deeply
felt emotion. The last time Momo saw her father they had a fight; now, all
she has left to remember him is an incomplete letter he wrote, penned with
the words “Dear Momo” but nothing more. Moving with her mother to the remote
Japanese island of Shio, Momo soon discovers in her attic three yokai,
mischievous spirit creatures that only she can see and who create mayhem as
she tries to keep them hidden. But these funny monsters have a serious
side—and may hold the key to helping Momo discover what her father had been
trying to tell her.

*A Letter to Momo* was seven years in the making. The hand-drawn animation is
superb, from the serenity of the island’s Shinto shrines to the climactic
finale, a frantic chase featuring thousands of ghosts and spirits that is
the best cinematic flight of supernatural fancy in years. (Dir.: Hiroyuki
Okiura, Japan, 2011, 120 min., Blu Ray, English)
