Beginning with John F. Kennedy, every President has received a short,
personalized daily report from the intelligence community. This top-secret
document is known as the President’s Daily Brief, or, within national security
circles, as simply “the Book.”  David Priess, former intelligence officer and
daily briefer, has interviewed every living President and Vice President as
well as more than one hundred others intimately involved with the production and
delivery of the President’s book of secrets. He offers an unprecedented window
into the decision-making of every President from Kennedy to Obama.
