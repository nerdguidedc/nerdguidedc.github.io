Are solar panels and LEED-certified buildings enough to make a "green city"?
With a growing reputation as a leader among green, sustainable cities,
Washington, DC's civic leaders and designers are taking a deeper look at how
urban nature can support resident wellbeing. From biophilic design and policy,
to the presence of wildlife-friendly landscapes, nature is making a comeback in
the nation's capital.

Urban planner and co-founder of Biophilic DC, Stella Tarnay, will discuss
Washington's evolution from a "green" city to a biophilic one, with a growing
commitment to biodiversity and access to nature for all.
