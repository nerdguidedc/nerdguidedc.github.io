What happens when three comedians play 20 Questions with a space historian?
Find out at a special Smithsonian Associates presentation of You’re the Expert,
a new radio program at the intersection of science and comedy. The show,
from Boston’s NPR station WBUR, mashes up entertainment and academia with uproarious results.

Host and creator Chris Duffy knows the value of humor in fact-finding
as a comedian and former fifth-grade teacher. In each episode,
a panel of three comics hone their guesses through games and sketches—with
some hilarious missteps—to discover what a guest expert does all day.
The show ends with an insightful interview about the latest findings in
the specialist’s field.

Be part of the audience for this live taping of You’re the Expert featuring
historian Valerie Neal, curator and chair of the Space History department
at the Smithsonian’s National Air and Space Museum. 30 Rock’s Scott Adsit,
Irish comedian Maeve Higgins, and another guest comic delve into her
unique, out-of-this-world focus.     

Curious what that may be? Past questioners have puzzled out the specialty
of researchers who study bats and fish noises (not at the same time),
a linguist who’s read the entire Oxford English Dictionary, and the
head of Harvard’s Comparative Lactation Lab. So your guess is as good as
the panel’s.

Underlying the comedy in You’re the Expert is a serious goal: to share
the passion and play behind the complex ideas and important research that
fill the worlds of its guest-star experts. And to make their work a
lot more accessible—and entertaining—than you’d think.
