Join Hear Now! for a special conversation with Martin Di Caro. Di Caro is a

Martin Di Caro has been WAMU's transportation reporter since February 2012. He
covers local, regional, and national issues facing the residents of the
heavily-congested, transit-rich Washington metropolitan area. His work often
focuses on the intersection of transportation, land use, and public policy, and
he has become the foremost journalist covering the enormous problems plaguing
the D.C. Metro subway system. Since June and the start of Metro's SafeTrack
rebuilding program, Martin has regularly appeared on Fox5 Washington as an
expert analyst. He also works for the Associated Press Radio Network in D.C. and
New York.

The event is free and open to the public but [registration is
