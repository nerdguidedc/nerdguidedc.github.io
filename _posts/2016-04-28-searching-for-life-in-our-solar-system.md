Where might we find life in the solar system?  Intriguing possibilities
include the watery plumes of Enceladus, the subsurface of Mars that
might hold the remains of past life, and the methane seas of Titan that
might have life different from any we know. In this lecture, Chris
McKay, planetary scientist at NASA Ames Research Center, will discuss
the ongoing search for life within our solar system.

The event is free and open to the public but
[advance tickets](http://airandspace.si.edu/events/detail.cfm?id=19814)
are required.

### Exploring Space Lecture Series

**Life in the Solar System and Beyond**

Exploration of our solar system has revealed a great diversity of
worlds and a variety of unexpected environments. Could they support
simple life? Candidate locations include an ocean of water under
Europa's frigid crust and subsurface regions of Enceladus that have
been tantalizingly revealed by active geysers. New technologies are
enabling the search for worlds with habitable environments beyond
the solar system as well, and on our own planet, extreme environments
where life exists can be studied as planetary analogs. In this
series, four distinguished speakers will describe the latest
developments as we look for life in a lot of strange places.
