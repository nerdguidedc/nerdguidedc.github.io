Recently, a number of new feature-length documentaries and ciné-essays have
focused on museum culture, from their architecture to their collections,
exhibitions, renovations, behind-the-scenes politics, and public controversies.
Representing a variety of styles from docudrama to experimental, The Grandest
Spaces includes recent films on museums in London, Vienna, Paris, Amsterdam,
Saint Petersburg, Madrid, and other cities. The series is organized on the
occasion of the National Gallery of Art’s seventy-fifth anniversary.

**Hieronymus Bosch — Touched by the Devil**  
July 16 at 1:00  

Visiting the Prado, Noordbrabants Museum in Den Bosch (where Bosch spent most of
his life), Rotterdam’s Boijmans Van Beuningen, Vienna’s Albertina, the Louvre,
the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the National Gallery of Art, Hieronymus
Bosch — Touched by the Devil constructs a portrait of this painter and his world
through conversations recorded over the course of a decade with conservators,
Bosch specialists, and museum personnel. The film focuses on preparations for
honoring the five-hundredth anniversary of Bosch’s death in August 1516. (Pieter
van Huystee, 2015, subtitles, DCP, 80 minutes)

**Sagrada: The Mystery of Creation**  
July 16 at 3:00  

Sagrada Família, Barcelona’s basilica of the holy family, was conceived by a
nineteenth-century bookseller and eventually became the passion project of
Catalan visionary artist Antoni Gaudí. The fascinating story is retold by Swiss
filmmaker Stefan Haupt and a team of architects, historians, artists, and
others, who ponder this strange and still unfinished Gothic masterwork. Though
technically not a museum, the church has become an art and culture mecca for
thousands, and is one of the grandest, most mysterious spaces in the world.
(Stefan Haupt, 2012, DCP, 95 minutes)

**National Gallery**  
July 23 at 2:00  

Documentarian Frederick Wiseman has been recording the inner workings of various
social institutions ever since his first film, Titicut Follies, exposed the
lives of patient-inmates at Bridgewater State Hospital for the criminally
insane. In National Gallery, he visually probes the public and private spaces of
London’s venerable art museum searching for what makes this place tick. He
favors its public face — the camera often serving as the eye and ear of the
visitor in the galleries — though there are revealing moments among
administrators, curators, educators, conservators, and other staff. “In effect,
National Gallery is about the effort to cut through the essential institutional
qualities of the institution — qualities without which no museum can survive —
in order to approach the transcendent sublimity of the art that it contains” —
Richard Brody. (Frederick Wiseman, 2014, DCP, 181 minutes)

**The New Rijksmuseum**  
July 30 at 1:00  

After ten years of complicated politics, colossal effort, and considerable cost,
Amsterdam’s fabled and now restored Rijksmuseum reopened to glowing reviews and
a deluge of eager visitors from around the world. The New Rijksmuseum follows
the drawn-out and contentious renovation process, exploring issues from
slow-moving government entities to the well-organized lobby of Dutch bicyclists,
who considered the new main entrance a menace. Following debates among
supporters, curators, administrators, and marketers, this is the unabridged
version of the film that, according to one commentator, “depicts nuances of
character and situation as finely as the finest novel or creative nonfiction.”
(Oeke Hoogendijk, 2013, DCP, subtitles, 228 minutes with intermission)

**Francofonia**  
August 7 at 4:00  

Russian auteur Alexander Sokurov’s films occupy a unique niche in the panorama
of contemporary cinema. Inquiring, contemplative, and demanding, his varied
oeuvre explores art and its relationship to the human soul. In his recent
Francofonia, Sokurov turns his attention to the Louvre, but not simply as a
museum. Instead, he uses that institution to launch a meditation on sovereignty,
past values, and culture. He focuses on the alliance between Louvre director
Jacques Jaujard (1895–1967) and German officer and art historian Count Franz von
Wolff-Metternich (1893–1978), who together tried to save the Louvre’s treasures
during the German occupation. This experimental ciné-essay expands to become a
reverie of Paris, French civilization (told in part through spirits inhabiting
the Louvre), and the documentation of history itself. (Alexander Sokurov, 2015,
DCP, subtitles, 90 minutes)

**The Great Museum**  
August 20 at 2:00  

Commissioned by Emperor Franz Joseph I to house the Habsburgs’ encyclopedic
collections, Vienna’s Kunsthistorisches Museum is one of the most awe-inspiring
institutions in the world. To produce his film, Johannes Holzhausen and his crew
spent nearly three years gathering material, including footage of the
reinstallation of the exotic Hapsburg treasury known as the Kunstkammer. The
often amusing exchanges among the staff provide unparalleled glimpses of the
day-to-day operations of this formidable institution. (Johannes Holzhausen,
2014, DCP, subtitles, 94 minutes)

**James Benning's Natural History**  
August 20 at 4:00  

American minimalist (and mathematician) James Benning portrays Vienna’s Museum
of Natural History in fifty-four shots of non-public areas. Benning’s vision,
which avoids the convivial clamor of most public museums, suggests the stillness
of an earlier era, when museums were places for quiet musings. “Natural History
began about five years ago when the director of the Museum of Natural History
Vienna, Christian Koeberl, invited me to lunch. He wanted to talk about his
second passion, film. Myself not liking film that much I immediately changed the
subject to meteorites, his first passion. Over a schnitzel and the better part
of a rather good bottle of red wine I received about two years of university
credit on the subject. Then with a boyhood grin, Christian asked if I’d like to
see the storage rooms. We spent another few hours looking at the stuff stored
and at the underground architecture itself. I told Christian I think I’d like to
make a film there, a landscape film, and without hesitation he said yes. I had
complete access to the building for thirteen straight days. The editing is based
on the first twenty-seven digits of pi” — James Benning. (James Benning, 2014,
HD digital, 77 minutes)

**Russian Ark**  
August 28 at 4:00  

A directorial and cinematographic tour de force filmed within the Hermitage —
the ark in which Russian identity is held — Russian Ark was filmed in one
seamless Steadicam take, the lengthiest sustained shot in the history of film.
As the viewer glides through corridors, ballrooms, and galleries, a vast
ensemble of actors and performers in full historic costume reenact episodes from
Russia’s imperial past, from the seventeenth century to the pre-Revolutionary
twentieth century. “A ghost story, a magnificent conjuring act, an eerie
historical mirage evoked in a single sweeping wave of the hand by Sokurov” —
Stephen Holden. (Alexander Sokurov, 2002, DCP, 100 minutes)
