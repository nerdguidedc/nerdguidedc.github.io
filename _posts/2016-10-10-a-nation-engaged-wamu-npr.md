NPR is your trusted source for coverage of the Presidential election. WAMU is
your trusted source for coverage of local Washington, D.C. The two public radio
organizations are coming together to hear from you. We want to know: "What does
it mean to you to be an American? And what could the next president do to
advance your vision?"

Join Kojo Nnamdi of WAMU and Asma Khalid of NPR at Hill Center to share your
thoughts and discuss with neighbors from around the city and region.

The event is free and open to the public but
