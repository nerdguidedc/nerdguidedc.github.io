Since 1991, the Carnegie Institution has hosted extraordinary
researchers from a wide range of scientific disciplines as part
of the Capital Science Evenings lecture series. The lectures
provide a unique opportunity to connect with some of the most
gifted investigators in science and hear the stories behind
their discoveries.

All lectures are free and open to the public, and begin at 6:45 PM
at the Carnegie Institute for Science.
These hour-long lectures, followed by a brief
question and answer period, go beyond the media accounts for a
firsthand look at the “ah-ha” moments, the setbacks, and the triumphs
that drive brilliant minds and fundamentally change our understanding
of the world around us.

Registration is required. You can [register online](https://carnegiescience.edu/events/lectures/dr-sean-carroll%E2%80%94-serengeti-rules-quest-ot-discover-how-nature-works-and-why-it).

####  The Serengeti Rules: The Quest To Discover How Nature Works & Why It Matters

Everything in nature is regulated—from the number of vital molecules found in
our bloodstreams to the number of lions living on an African savanna. Over the
past 50 years, two revolutions have occurred in the study of biology that help
scientists understand how life is regulated on both of these scales. Dr.
Carroll will discuss the discovery of the so-called "Serengeti Rules," which
govern the number and kinds of animals and plants that are found found in any
given place, and talk about how these rules can be applied to restoring
ecological health.

Dr. Sean B. Carroll, Professor, Molecular Biology and Genetics, University of
Wisconsin; Vice President for Science Education, Howard Hughes Medical Institute
