  On May 15 discover the "criminal possibilities" of architecture and the city

  Manaugh and Anderson discuss the book's themes and clips from movies such as
  Oceans Eleven, The Italian Job, Thief, Rififi, Drive, and The Bank Job,
  exploring how looters outwit the built environment in real life, and on the
  big screen.

Discover the "criminal possibilities" of architecture and the city with
Geoff Manaugh, author of A Burglar's Guide to the City. Manaugh investigates
urban planning, security design, and heists over more than two millennia
through his new book. Joined by Ross Andersen of The Atlantic, Manaugh and
Anderson discuss the book's themes and clips from movies such as Oceans
Eleven, The Italian Job, Thief, Rififi, Drive, and The Bank Job, exploring
how looters outwit the built environment in real life, and on the big screen.

"If you look closely, from just the right angle," Manaugh writes,
"every city implies the crimes that will someday take place there."
