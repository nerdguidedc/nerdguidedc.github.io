Since 1991, the Carnegie Institution has hosted extraordinary
researchers from a wide range of scientific disciplines as part
of the Capital Science Evenings lecture series. The lectures
provide a unique opportunity to connect with some of the most
gifted investigators in science and hear the stories behind
their discoveries.

All lectures are free and open to the public, and begin at 6:45 PM
at the Carnegie Institute for Science.
These hour-long lectures, followed by a brief
question and answer period, go beyond the media accounts for a
firsthand look at the “ah-ha” moments, the setbacks, and the triumphs
that drive brilliant minds and fundamentally change our understanding
of the world around us.

Registration is required. You can [register online](https://carnegiescience.edu/events/lectures/dr-elizabeth-loftus-fiction-memory).

####  The Fiction Of Memory

For several decades, Dr. Elizabeth Loftus has been manufacturing memories in
unsuspecting minds. Sometimes this involves changing details of events that
someone actually experienced. Other times, it involves planting entire memories
of events that never happened—something called “rich false memories.” People
can be led to believe that they have done implausible things. They can be led
to falsely believe that they had experiences that would have been emotional or
traumatic had they actually happened.  False memories, like true ones, also
have consequences for people, affecting later thoughts, intentions, and
behaviors. Can we tell true memories from false ones? In several studies,
Loftus created false memories in the minds of people, and then compared them to
true memories. Once planted, the false memories look very much like true
memories, in terms of behavioral characteristics, emotionality, and neural
signatures.  If false memories can be so readily planted in the mind, do we
need to think about “regulating” this mind technology? And what do these
pseudo-memories say about the nature of memory itself?

Dr. Elizabeth Loftus, Distinguished Professor, University of California Irvine
