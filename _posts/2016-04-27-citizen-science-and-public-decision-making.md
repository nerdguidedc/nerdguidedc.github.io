Considering it is difficult for professional scientists to reach public decision
makers in a normal policy setting, the Commons Lab and the Environmental Law
Institute assumed these disconnects might occur for citizen science projects as
well.

As a step towards identifying and remedying this, we designed a research paper
that would illustrate the many legal and administrative procedures in the United
States that dictate whether certain data and research conclusions can be used
and relied upon to make decisions about air quality, land use, water quality
and many more environmental factors.

Knowledge of these procedural qualifiers can greatly enhance the quality
assurance and control factors in citizen science project design and ideally
reach intended decision makers more effectively.

Please join us for the launch of this research paper and a panel discussion with
the authors on some of the key findings. Paper copies of the report will also
be available.
