Join the [Northern Virginia Astronomy Club](http://www.novac.com/) (NOVAC) for [Astronomy Day](http://www.novac.com/wp/outreach/astronomyday/) at Sky
Meadows State Park on Saturday, May 7, 2016. Astronomy Day is a national event
usually held in or around April to promote and share amateur astronomy. Come
out at 3 pm to observe the Sun! Stay until nightfall to see some planets and
deep sky objects! Entrance to the park ends at 9 pm no exceptions!

The presentation portion is rain or shine (we'll have a tent set up).
Presentations cover a range of topics in amateur and professional astronomy
and are generally appropriate for all ages. Younger children might appreciate
our field events, though, which are more interactive and hands-on. 

Enjoy the wonderful views of the landscape and night sky from the flanks
of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The program features solar observing through
safe filters, telescopes to look at and look through when the stars come
out, and presentations about astronomy and the night sky.

You don't need any astronomy experience or equipment at all to enjoy
Astronomy Day. If you own a pair of binoculars, go ahead and bring them;
they're great for looking at the night sky. There will be no shortage of
optics of all sizes and shapes offering views of everything overhead.
Feel free to walk around and enjoy the sights through the equipment on
display. Just about any telescope owner will be glad to let you have a
look, but please ask the owner before using.

Sky Meadows State Park charges $5 per vehicle for parking, but the event
itself is completely free. NOVAC members are admitted free upon
presentation of a membership card (available from the members-only
section of the website). If you're not a member but would like to
become one, you can join the club online and print your membership
card in only a few minutes.
