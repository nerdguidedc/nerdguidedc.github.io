The annual festival of Iranian cinema, a selection of new films plus a tribute
this year to the late director Abbas Kiarostami (1940–2016), is copresented in
Washington by the Freer Gallery of Art, National Gallery of Art, and AFI Silver
Theatre. The program, organized by Tom Vick of the Freer and Sackler Galleries,
Carter Long of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and Marian Luntz of the Museum
of Fine Arts, Houston, is cosponsored by the ILEX Foundation. For the full
program, go to [asia.si.edu/films](http://asia.si.edu/films).

The films to be screened are:

### Radio Dreams

Radio Dreams features Mohsen Namjoo (“Iran’s Bob Dylan”) in a brilliantly
deadpan performance as Hamid Royani, the put-upon program director of Pars
Radio, a Bay Area Persian-language station. A famous writer in exile, Royani is
exasperated with the station’s mix of provincial programming and advertising
jingles, and on the day during which the film takes place it appears he’s
managed a coup when the band Metallica agrees to jam on-air with Afghan rock
group Kabul Dreams. As the famed rockers’ arrival suffers delay after delay,
tensions at Pars Radio hilariously boil over. (Spoiler alert: at least one
member of Metallica shows up.) (Babak Jalili, 2016, DCP, Persian and English
with subtitles, 91 minutes)

### The Salesman

From Aghar Farhadi, director of A Separation, comes a “finely-cut gem of
neorealist suspense” (Owen Gleiberman). Shahab Hosseini won the best actor award
at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival for his portrayal of Emad, who is first seen
fleeing from a collapsing apartment building with his wife Rana (Taraneh
Alidoosti). When Rana is attacked by an intruder in their new home, Emad turns
amateur detective. Farhadi’s screenplay makes clever use of Arthur Miller’s
Death of a Salesman (the couple appear in a local production). (Asghar Farhadi,
Iran/France, 2016, DCP, Persian and French with subtitles, 125 minutes)

### Me (aka I)

For longtime followers of Iranian cinema, brilliant actress Leila Hatami needs
no introduction. Feted with awards around the world for her performances in such
films as Leila and A Separation, she is one of Iran’s most recognizable and
compelling performers. In Soheil Beiraghi’s debut, she plays the force-of-nature
queen of Tehran’s underground, a ruthless and enigmatic fixer, staying one step
ahead of the law as she forges passports, moves illicit booze, and effortlessly
emasculates a musical protégé. Me (aka I) is an eye-opening depiction of
Tehran’s surprisingly robust underworld. (Soheil Beiraghi, 2016, Persian and
English with subtitles, 84 minutes)

### Drought and Lie

During a birthday celebration at a Caspian Sea getaway, lawyer Omid receives a
call from his ex-wife Mitra, inflaming the jealousy of his current wife, Ala.
The call sets in motion a round-robin of betrayal and soul-searching that sends
ripples through their circle of family and friends: a rare, penetrating look
into the lives of Iran’s upwardly mobile set whose problems are complicated by
their country’s societal rules. (Pedram Alizadeh, 2016, DCP, Persian with
subtitles, 94 minutes)

### Lantouri

Reza Dormishian is one of Iran’s most provocative young directors. In Lantouri,
named for a brutal criminal gang, he crafts a daring scenario, “a must-see for
those wanting to take the pulse of what’s happening in Iran” — Alissa Simon. A
gang member injures a female criminal-rights activist who demands justice
through the concept in Islamic law known as lex talionis, an eye for an eye. The
film’s bold social messages are dramatized through equally bold stylistic
decisions, ranging from Godard-like jump cuts to mock-documentary interviews to
nonlinear narration. (Reza Dormishian, 2016, DCP, Persian with subtitles, 115
minutes)

### Taste of Cherry

The deceptively simple plot of the late Abbas Kiarostami’s Taste of Cherry masks
the depths it plumbs in its characterizations and ideas. Middle-aged Mr. Badii
(Homayoun Ershadi) drives through a barren landscape looking for somebody to
agree to bury him after he takes his own life. Badii is calm about his decision,
despite the entreaties of each of the three candidates he tries to persuade, as
their conversations become an evolving philosophical argument about the value of
life. Featuring a conclusion that is one of the most debated and discussed in
the history of cinema, this is perhaps Kiarostami’s most enduring masterpiece.
(Abbas Kiarostami, 1997, 35mm, Persian with subtitles, 95 minutes)

### 76 Minutes and 15 Seconds with Kiarostami preceded by Take Me Home

Paul Cornin and Hamid Dabashi in person  

The unexpected death of Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami in 2016 shocked and
saddened the world’s film community. Seifollah Samadian’s recent documentary
recalls this innovative and generous artist. Behind-the-scenes footage mixes
with unguarded moments in a tribute that is as “joyfully moving and as modern in
approach as Kiarostami himself” — Deborah Young. (Seifollah Samadian, 2016, DCP,
Persian with subtitles, 76 minutes)

Preceding is Kiarostami’s final short film Take Me Home (2016, 16 minutes), a
playful look at the alleys and stairways of southern Italy. A discussion with
authors Paul Cornin (Lessons with Kiarostami, 2015) and Hamid Dabashi (Masters
and Masterpieces of Iranian Cinema, 2007) follows.
