excerpt: >
  What happens to us after we die? A decomposing corpse becomes its own
  mini-ecosystem, hosting insects, scavengers and multitudes of microbes.
  Microbes from the environment, the corpse, as well as the insects and
  scavengers are blended together and work to recycle tissues back to their
  constituents. On October 19, Dr. Jennifer DeBruyn will discuss the fascinating
  process of human decomposition, and how scientists are using that information
  to inform forensic science, livestock mortality management and fossilization.

In May 2012, the American Society for Microbiology launched a Happy Hour series
called “Microbes After Hours” which gathers together scientists and curious
citizens at ASM headquarters in Washington DC for relaxed evenings of
appetizers, drinks, and exciting microbiology talks by renowned experts.  Since
the inaugural session, the series has tackled topics such as “Microbes and
Microbrews: the Microbiology of Brewing Beer,” “The Human Microbiome: My
Microbes, Myself,” and “The Return of Influenza.”  The series has grown beyond
its local roots to bring together scientists and enthusiastic learners from all
over the globe through live broadcasts on MicrobeWorld. Join ASM for this series
of events open to both ASM members and non-members alike.
