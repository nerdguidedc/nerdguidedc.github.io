excerpt: >
  Can you fix the debt? Play 'The Fiscal Ship' at Brookings on April 27.
  The game was developed through a partnership between the Woodrow Wilson
  International Center for Scholars and the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and
  Monetary Policy at Brookings. Rising federal debt isn't a game. It's a
  real problem—and many Americans know that. We hope you'll join us to
  play "The Fiscal Ship" and spread the word about the problem and actual
  solutions to the dangers of rising debt.

All along the campaign trail, presidential candidates continue to make promises
they can't keep. They promise to give voters trillions in tax cuts while also
balancing the budget and protecting popular programs from budget cuts.

Fact-checking journalists and spreadsheet-wielding advocates of fiscal
responsibility challenge those assertions, but reach a small slice of the
population. So we asked: What else can be done to communicate the scale
and scope of the debt problem?

To start with, we made a game. Whimsical, but grounded in the fiscal facts,
"The Fiscal Ship" allows players with little background in the budget
to come up with their own plan to stabilize the debt without compromising their values.

We're hoping you'll join us for the launch of our "Fiscal Ship" to see it for yourself.
Are you a fiscal hawk? Or a staunch environmentalist? Your own priorities will
affect how you lower the debt, and "The Fiscal Ship" will teach you what will and won't work.

The game was developed through a partnership between the Woodrow Wilson
International Center for Scholars and the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and
Monetary Policy at Brookings. To kick off the informal event, Hutchins
Center Director David Wessel will make brief opening remarks about how
the game was made, what choices went into its underlying policies, and what
we learned from early testing. After Wessel's remarks, participants will
be invited to play the game, enjoy complimentary refreshments, and
network with other members of the policy community.

Rising federal debt isn't a game. It's a real problem—and many Americans
know that. We hope you’ll join us to play "The Fiscal Ship" and spread
the word about the problem and actual solutions to the dangers of rising debt.
