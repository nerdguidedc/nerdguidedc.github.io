The three-time Pulitzer Prize recipient and columnist for The New York Times
Thomas Friedman asserts that we have entered an age of dizzying acceleration.
His new book, Thank You For Being Late: An Optimist’s Guide to Thriving in the
Age of Accelerations, serves as a field manual for how to think about and live
in this era of technological and global shifts. The book makes the case for
‘being late’—pausing to appreciate this amazing historical era and to reflect on
its possibilities and dangers.

On Thursday, December 15, the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program will host
Friedman for a conversation about his book and a discussion about the lessons he
draws from his hometown in Minnesota about how communities can create a “topsoil
of trust” to anchor their increasingly diverse and digital populations.

Following the discussion, he will take questions from the audience.
