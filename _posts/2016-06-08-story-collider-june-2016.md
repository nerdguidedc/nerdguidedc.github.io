Science surrounds us. Even when we don't notice it, science touches
almost every part of our lives. [Story Collider](http://www.storycollider.org/),
is a live storytelling project and podcast that believes that everyone has
a story to tell about science.

The next show in Washington DC – Surfacing – will be held on [World Oceans
Day](http://www.worldoceansday.org/) and will present true tales of
adventures on the high seas and stories of getting in over your head.
Storytellers include the chairperson of DC Surfrider, a TED Fellow, a NPR
science correspondent, a retired Rear Admiral of the Navy, and a sailor and
former Knauss Fellow. [Tickets are $12](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-story-collider-washington-dc-june-2016-tickets-25208115151).

#### Storytellers

**Anupa Asokan** is the chairperson for the Washington, DC chapter of the
Surfrider Foundation and for her day job, works at NOAA's office of Oceanic and
Atmospheric Research in communications. Anupa has a masters in oceanography and
an MBA from the University of Rhode Island and a bachelors in atmospheric and
oceanic science from UCLA. She's already lived the dream -- teaching marine
science, "aquaristing," and adventuring on Catalina Island, but still aspires to
one day live the life of a mermaid. Until then, she hopes to bring awareness to
ocean issues and do what she can to help protect it. Follow her at @anupaasokan.

**Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson** is a Ph.D. marine biologist, policy expert,
former Executive Director of the Waitt Institute, and independent consultant,
currently in residence at TED. Johnson builds bridges between science, policy,
and people, so we can use natural resources without using them up. Follow her at
@ayanaeliza.  

**Christopher Joyce** is a correspondent on the science desk at NPR. His stories
can be heard on all of NPR's news programs, including NPR's Morning Edition, All
Things Considered, and Weekend Edition. He’s a musician and sailor. Follow him
@christophjoyce.

**Rear Admiral Jonathan W. White, USN (ret.)** serves as the President and CEO
of the Consortium for Ocean Leadership, a Washington, DC-based nonprofit that
represents the leading ocean science and technology institutions with the
mission to advance research, education and sound ocean policy. Previously he had
a distinguished 32-year career in the U.S. Navy, including appointments as the
Director of Navy’s Task Force Climate Change, and Navy Deputy to NOAA. White’s
passion for the ocean and science began at a very early age as he grew up near
Florida’s Gulf Coast. He earned a B.S. in Oceanographic Technology from the
Florida Institute of Technology, and a Master’s degree in Meteorology and
Oceanography from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School.

**Sandy Aylesworth** is a Foreign Affairs Officer working in climate change
mitigation at the U.S. Department of State. As a 2014 Knauss Fellow, Sandy
supported NOAA’s Congressional outreach and Tribal Relations work. Sandy
transitioned to environmental policy following a nine-year career as a mate and
captain on sailing and research vessels. Through voyages in French Polynesia,
Hawaii, Baja, the Caribbean, and Antarctica, Sandy became intimately familiar
with the oceans and solidified her interest in marine policy. Over semester-long
voyages, Sandy taught hundreds of students ship maneuvering, sail handling, and
nautical science. She served as a Marine Technician for the United States
Antarctic Program on seven oceanographic cruises. Sandy earned her Masters of
Environmental Management at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental
Studies, holds a B.A. Wesleyan University, and has a 500 Ton Ocean Master’s
license.
