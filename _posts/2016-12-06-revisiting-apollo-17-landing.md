  Remote-sensing observations of the Moon by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter
  have given scientists the data to develop new interpretations of the complex
  geology of the Taurus-Littrow Valley, the landing site of the last manned
  lunar mission. This free lecture will be at the Library of Congress on
  December 6.

Dr. Noah Petro, lunar geologist and Deputy Project Scientist for the mission
will give a free talk in the Library of Congress Pickford Theater: [Walking with
the Last Men on the Moon: Revisiting the Apollo 17 Landing Site with the Lunar
Reconnaissance Orbiter](https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/events/events.html).

At 12:33 a.m. on December 7, 1972, Apollo 17 lifted off in the Florida night on
a Saturn V rocket carrying Gene Cernan, Ron Evans, and Jack Schmitt on the final
Apollo Moon mission. On December 11, while Evans remained behind, commander
Cernan and geologist Schmitt landed in the lunar module Challenger.  Over the
next 75 hours they conducted the longest lunar exploration in the Apollo
program.

The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) was launched in June 2009 and has been
gathering data on the lunar environment that will help pave the way for humans
to return to the Moon and for future human exploration of our solar system.
Photos taken by the LRO of the Apollo 17 site clearly show the tracks of the
lunar rover, which remains parked on the Moon, as well as the foot trails of the
astronauts who walked there 44 years ago. Remote-sensing observations by the
spacecraft have given scientists the data to develop new interpretations of the
complex geology of the Taurus-Littrow Valley explored by Apollo 17.
