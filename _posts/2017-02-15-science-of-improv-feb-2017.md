Join the National Academy of Sciences for an evening with the Washington Improv
Theater’s WIT@Work program. Whether you’re a graduate student preparing to

explain your work to those outside of your field, or simply someone who is
looking to improve your public speaking confidence, WIT@Work’s interactive
improv techniques offer a fun way to learn how to better communicate
authentically, off-the-cuff, and in potentially high-pressure situations.
Tickets are $7 ($5 for students) and include complimentary refreshments.
