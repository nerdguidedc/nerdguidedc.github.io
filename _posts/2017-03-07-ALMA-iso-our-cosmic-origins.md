excerpt: >
  Since releasing its first images of space 5 years ago, the Atacama Large
  Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has produced many exciting and
  fundamental results, enabling transformational science in a wide range of
  astronomy and planetary science subjects, from the Solar System to the early
  universe. On March 7, Dr. Pierre Cox will present a selection of the
  most-remarkable ALMA scientific discoveries, compare the array’s original
  fundamental science with its current results, and outline the future evolution
  of ALMA.

Since 1991, the Carnegie Institution has hosted extraordinary
researchers from a wide range of scientific disciplines as part
of the Capital Science Evenings lecture series. The lectures
provide a unique opportunity to connect with some of the most
gifted investigators in science and hear the stories behind
their discoveries.

All lectures are free and open to the public, and begin at 6:30 PM
at the Carnegie Institute for Science. Doors open at 6:00.
These hour-long lectures, followed by a brief
question and answer period, go beyond the media accounts for a
firsthand look at the “ah-ha” moments, the setbacks, and the triumphs
that drive brilliant minds and fundamentally change our understanding
of the world around us.

Registration is required. You can [register online](https://carnegiescience.edu/events/lectures/dr-pierre-cox-alma-search-our-cosmic-origins).

#### ALMA: In Search of Our Cosmic Origins

The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) released its first
images of space in October 2011. Throughout its first half decade, ALMA has
produced many exciting and fundamental results, enabling transformational
science in a wide range of astronomy and planetary science subjects, from the
Solar System to the early universe. Dr. Cox will present a selection of the
most-remarkable ALMA scientific discoveries, compare the array’s original
fundamental science with its current results, and outline the future evolution
of ALMA.

Dr. Pierre Cox, Director, ALMA.
