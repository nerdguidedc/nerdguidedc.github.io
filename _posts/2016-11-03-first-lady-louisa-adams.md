In "Louisa: The Extraordinary Life of Mrs. Adams" (Penguin, 2016), author
Louisa Thomas presents the first comprehensive biography of the nation’s only
foreign-born first lady.

Thomas will discuss and sign her book, which was researched at the Library of
Congress, on Thursday, Nov. 3, at noon in the Montpelier Room, located on the
sixth floor of the James Madison Building, 101 Independence Ave. S.E.,
Washington, D.C. This Books & Beyond event is sponsored by the Center for the
Book in the Library of Congress. It is free and open to the public; no tickets
are required.

Louisa Catherine Johnson (1775-1852) was born in London on the eve of the
American Revolution. Her parents, an American father who was appointed consul
general for the United States in 1790 and a British mother, raised her as an
American and wanted her to marry one. She met John Quincy Adams in 1795 at her
father’s house. After a tempestuous courtship, Louisa and John Quincy married
and eventually moved to America.

Louisa Adams’s story is one of political adeptness and support of her husband’s
ambition to become U.S. president.
