Michael Signer will discuss and sign his new book [Becoming Madison: The
Extraordinary Origins of the Least Likely Founding Father](https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-16-203/book-talk-highlights-james-madisons-pivotal-role-in-american-government/2016-11-23/).

Becoming Madison is an intellectual and psychological biography that takes a
fresh look at the life of the United States’ fourth president, focusing on
Madison before age 36, when he did his most enduring work—learning at the elbow
of the great iconoclast and revolutionary cleric John Witherspoon, battling with
Patrick Henry over religious freedom; introducing his framework for a robust and
resilient central government; becoming the intellectual godfather of the
Constitution’s brilliant checks and balances; and working to ratify the
Constitution at Virginia’s convention in 1788.

I reintroduce readers to a brilliant, improbably charismatic, powerfully driven,
and exquisitely sensitive young man, who was uncomfortable on the public stage
but whose passionate concern to shape a great and enduring nation compelled him
onto it.

Readers will be surprised to learn the nine-part “Method” by which tiny, deeply
reserved man defeated the anti-Federalists and saved the Constitution. They will
read about the crippling anxiety attacks that plagued Madison through his life,
including during the ratification convention in Richmond. They will discover the
dramatic precedents for Madison’s triumph in the Constitution, including his
battles for legal reform, religious freedom, and macroeconomic policy. They’re
read about the eerie parallels of Madison’s battle against his former mentor
Patrick Henry with current struggles with “Tea Party” forces in American
politics. And they’ll delve into Madison’s profound intellectual relationship
with his mentor and professor John Witherspoon.

This event is free and open to the public. Advance registration is not required.
