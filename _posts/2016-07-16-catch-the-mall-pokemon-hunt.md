The hunt is on! [Join a National Park Ranger Pokemon
Trainer](https://www.facebook.com/events/256703658048805/) on a hunt to discover
the hidden treasures of the National Mall! Not only will you potentially find
that Charizard you've been hunting for, but you'll discover just what makes some
of our nation's most iconic landmarks so remarkable!

We've established three hunting zones, each assigned a Park Ranger Pokemon
Trainer who will accompany you on your hunt. At 2pm on Saturday, July 16th, and
again on Sunday, July 17th, show up at one of these three locations to meet your
trainer:

1. Ranger Trainer Zach will be on the National Mall near the Smithsonian Metro
Stop   
2. Ranger Trainer Paul will be on the plaza in front of the Lincoln
Memorial  
3. Ranger Trainer Kellen will be on the plaza in front of the
Jefferson Memorial (next to the Tidal Basin)  

So join us this Saturday and you can Catch the Mall while you try to Catch 'em
all!
