The [Environmental Film Festival](http://dceff.org/) in the 
Nation’s Capital is the world’s
premier showcase of environmentally themed films. Through the annual
festival, year-round events, and online resources, they seek to
advance public understanding of the environment through the power
of film.

Each March in Washington, DC is the largest environmental film
festival in the United States, presenting more than 100 films
to an audience of over 30,000. Often combined with thematic
discussions and social events, the films screen at museums,
embassies, libraries, universities and local theaters.
Many of the screenings are free, and all are open to the public.

EFF also partners with filmmakers, distributors, and venues to
present environmental films throughout the year. The Washington, DC
location offers the unique ability for films and filmmakers to reach
national decision makers.

Founded in 1993, EFF is the longest-running environmental film
festival in the United States. It has grown into a major
collaborative cultural event both during the festival season and 
all year-round.

Here are some of the films that will be shown at the festival:

### Another Way of Living: The Story of Reston, VA

In 1964, planner Robert Simon built a suburban utopia that combined
the communal spaces of European cities with the natural expanses of
the American countryside.  That place is Reston.  In its early days,
it stood as a beacon of racial equality within a still-segregated
Virginia. Although the community has undergone major changes in the
past 50,years, much of Simon’s dream remains.  Another Way of Living
honors Simon’s legacy, following him in the final year of his life as
he tries to reconcile Reston’s commercial success with its original
principles.

### The Birth of Saké

The 144-year-old Yoshida Saké Brewery does things the old-fashioned
way: dedicated artisans work in concert with natural forces — the
temperature and humidity of the air, the chemistry of the water, the
swirling koji mold that fuels fermentation — to uphold a millennia-old
tradition. The craftsmen live a life of monastic focus, sleeping and
eating together under the brewery’s roof, but also one of great beauty.
Through rich cinematography and sensitive filmmaking, Erik Shirai
immerses us in the sensory world of saké, and in the whimsy and warmth
of the people who make it.

### The Creeping Garden

Plasmodial slime mold is like something out of science fiction:
creeping right beneath our feet, its intricate living systems warp our
perception of time and space and challenge our definitions of
“intelligent life.” This unlikely wonder inspires futuristic new work
at the vanguard of fields like biologically-inspired design,
emergence theory, computing, and robotics. Visually engrossing,
with a gripping experimental soundtrack by Jim O’Rourke, Creeping
Garden takes us deep into the world of slime mold and the fringe
artists and scientists who love it.

### E.O. Wilson: Of Ants and Men

When biologist E.O. Wilson discovered in the 1960s that ants use
pheromones to structure their complex societies, he opened the door
to a vastly expanded sense of our environment – and the limits of our
ability to perceive it. From “biodiversity” to “biophilia,” few
living thinkers have contributed more vital concepts to our
understanding of the natural world. E.O. Wilson: Of Ants and Men
traces his journey of discovery from its inception, through moments
of controversy, and into his recent conservation work in Mozambique.

### Merchants of Doubt

Inspired by the acclaimed book by Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway,
this film takes audiences on a satirically comedic, yet illuminating
ride into the heart of conjuring American spin. Documentarian Robert
Kenner (Food, Inc.) investigates the shadowy world of highly
charismatic, silver-tongued pundits-for-hire who present themselves
in the media as scientific authorities – yet have the contrary aim of
spreading doubt about well-studied public threats, ranging from toxic
chemicals to pharmaceuticals to climate change.

### Sky Line

The dream of building an elevator into space – a ribbon connecting
earth to an orbiting station – means many things to many people:
the solution to the energy crisis; a slingshot into deep space; the
democratization of recreational space travel. A scattered, often
embattled collection of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs
dedicate their lives to solving the hundreds of technical problems
keeping that dream from becoming a reality. Sky Line catches these
futurists at a key moment, when the discovery of “nanotube”
materials reinvigorates their fanciful project.
