Let’s follow [the theme of color](http://library.si.edu/event/color-studio)
through the vast collections of the Smithsonian
Libraries, and make a few unexpected connections and discoveries through

10:00 AM - 12:00 PM : 15 to 36 months

2:30 PM - 4:00 PM : Pre-K to Grade 3

Name a topic that links science, history, art, and culture. How about color?
Let’s follow the theme of color through the vast collections of the Smithsonian
Libraries, and make a few unexpected connections and discoveries. Most of us
take color for granted. We simply see it the moment that light beams from or
reflects off an object, enters our eyes, and is processed by our brains. But do
we stop to think what color actually is? Journeying through the collections of
the Smithsonian Libraries — from chemistry to catalogs, from colorblind tests
to couture — we might see color in a new light.
