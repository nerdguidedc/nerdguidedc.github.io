excerpt: >
  Science surrounds us. Even when we don't notice it, science touches
  almost every part of our lives. Story Collider is on March 16, a live
  storytelling project and podcast that believes that everyone has a story to
  tell about science.

What's it like to be on the outside looking in? Whether you're a metal head who
finds himself at a scientific conference or a glaciologist giving first aid to a
seal, we all have stories about feeling like we're a little out of our comfort
zone. This month, [Story
Collider](http://www.storycollider.org/shows/2017/2/9/washington-dc) brings you
stories of trying to find our place, whether in or through science, as
outsiders.

Stories by:

***Astrid Caldas*** is a climate scientist at the Union of Concerned
Scientists, where her work focuses on climate change adaptation and science
communication, with practical policy implications for ecosystems, the economy,
and society . She was born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where she
started her career as an ecologist, working with insects for most of her
academic life. After moving to the United States (Washington, DC area) in 1996,
she (unsurprisingly!) started developing a deeper interest in policy. She has a
lifelong passion for butterflies and moths, which she has studied for many years
and likes to use as models to raise awareness of climate and land use changes.
She blogs for The Huffington Post and tweets under the handle @climategeek.

***Richard Johnson*** plays in three metal bands and runs a music blog called
Disposable Underground. He's also a fan of space science and will
enthusiastically attend the People's Climate Movement march and the March for
Science in Washington DC. He lives and works in Arlington, Virginia.


***Gifford Wong*** is an American Association for the Advancement of Science
(AAAS) Science and Technology Policy Fellow working at the Department of State.
He previously served in the Senate as the American Geosciences Institute
Congressional Geoscience Fellow. He received his Ph.D. in Earth Sciences from
Dartmouth College, his Honours in Antarctic Studies from the University of
Tasmania at Hobart, and his Bachelorâ€™s degree in Asian American Studies from the
University of California at Berkeley. He has done fieldwork in Greenland and
Antarctica, co-developed and co-instructed a graduate-level science
communication course at Dartmouth, and thinks penguins and unicorns are cool.
Every now and again he is on Twitter as @giffordwong.

***Maureen Boyle*** is the Chief of the Science Policy Branch at the National
Institute on Drug Abuse or NIDA. She is a neuroscientist who has spent the last
7 years working on behavioral healthcare reform and drug policy. Prior to
joining NIDA she was a AAAS Science and Technology Policy Fellow at the NIH
Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research.  Before getting involved in
policy she studied the biological basis of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental
disorders. When she wants to get out of her brain she runs, does yoga, and tries
to apply Pavlov's lessons to her bulldog puppy.

***Ian Simon*** is writing his bio as we speak!
