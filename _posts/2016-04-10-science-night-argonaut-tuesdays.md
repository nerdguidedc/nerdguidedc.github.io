Are you:

* still bitter about that stinging 8th grade Science Fair defeat?
* a self-proclaimed ~~nerd~~ ”SCIENCE ENTHUSIAST”?
* highly competitive?
* open to making a mess you don’t have to clean up yourself?
* Join us in the ArgoLab (also known as upstairs) for [Science Night!](http://argonautdc.com/specials/science-night/)

Every week they'll have a science or engineering challenge along with
science-themed trivia. They provide the materials, all you need to bring
is your friends and some smarts. Make a team, grab a kit and start
experimenting!

EAT FOOD. DRINK BOOZE. And COLLABORATE on the best way to WIN PRIZES
($50 Argo gift card for the challenge winners, $25 gift card for the
trivia winners, and a bottle of wine for the best team name. Wait,
this sounds familiar... Thanks, Pub Quiz!)

In the case of a tie, or (gasp) if there’s no experiment completion/success,
there will be extra trivia questions to help with scoring.

You should get there a little early to secure a seat and get
your orders in before the experiment starts.
