The Udvar-Hazy Center is hosting a
[family day](https://airandspace.si.edu/events/heritage-days/womens-history/) that celebrates the

days of the earliest pilots to today's space program, women have been
making significant contributions. During this event, visitors will
have the opportunity to meet female role models and learn about the

Throughout the history of aviation and space exploration, women have
