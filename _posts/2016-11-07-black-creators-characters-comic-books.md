[A panel discussion](http://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2016/16-192.html?loclr=eaue) at
the Library of Congress will explore the history of black characters, images and
creators in comic books. African-American-related comics and cartoons from the
Library of Congress collections will be on view for the event.

The panel discussion is hosted by the Library of Congress’ Serials and
Government Publications Division, Prints and Photographs Division and Office of
EEO and Diversity Programs; The Daniel A. P. Murray African American Cultural
Association; the Library of Congress Chapter of Blacks in Government; and the
Library of Congress Professional Association’s What If... Science Fiction and
Fantasy Forum.

In addition to the history of black creators and characters of comic books, the
panel will examine the degree to which early African-American superheroes
generally adhered to common stereotypes of black men. The comics and cartoons on
display will be drawn from the collections of the Library’s Prints and
Photographs Division and Serials and Government Publications Division.

Darrel Goza will lead the discussion. Goza is the head of Goza
Creative/ScriptGraphics Comic Books, a firm that specializes in commercial art
and design. He is a well-known author of African-American comics, who has
explored the history that has shaped the comic-book industry.

Also on the panel are David McClain and Katrina Oxner. McClain, co-owner of
Graphyc Rythmic Productions, is a cartoonist and illustrator. He does creative
work in the New York City area and has been in the graphic-arts business since
1987\. Oxner handles automated digital systems and social media integration for
Goza Creative/ScriptGraphics Comic Books. She also works on creative resources
and marketing for the firm.

The event is free and open to the public; registration is not required.
