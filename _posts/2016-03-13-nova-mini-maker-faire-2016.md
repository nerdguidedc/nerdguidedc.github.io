excerpt: >
  Maker Faire is the Greatest Show (and Tell) on Earth — a
  family-friendly showcase of invention, creativity and
  resourcefulness, and a celebration of the Maker Movement.
  It’s a place where people show what they are making, and
  share what they are learning. Makers range from tech enthusiasts
  to crafters to homesteaders to scientists to garage tinkerers.
  They are of all ages and backgrounds. The aim of Maker Faire
  is to entertain, inform, connect and grow this community.
