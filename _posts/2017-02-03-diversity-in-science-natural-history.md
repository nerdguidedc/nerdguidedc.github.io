The museum invites you to attend a special evening with prominent American
educator, mathematician, and president of University of Maryland, Baltimore
County, Dr. Freeman A. Hrabowski, III. Named one of the 100 Most Influential
People in the World by TIME (2012), Dr. Hrabowski is a passionate advocate for
growing diversity in STEM fields, and his work has influenced national agencies,
universities, and school systems.

Hrabowski will share his inspiring story – from participating in the 1963
Children’s Crusade for civil rights as a 12-year-old to serving as one of the
leading intellectuals in the field of education. His research and publications
focus on science and math education, with special emphasis on minority
participation and performance. He chaired the National Academies’ committee that
produced the 2011 report, _Expanding Underrepresented Minority Participation:
America’s Science and Technology Talent at the Crossroads_. He also was named by
President Obama to chair the President’s Advisory Commission on Educational
Excellence for African Americans.

With philanthropist Robert Meyerhoff, he co-founded the Meyerhoff Scholars
Program in 1988. The program is open to all high-achieving students committed to
pursuing advanced degrees and research careers in science and engineering, and
advancing underrepresented minorities in these fields. The program is recognized
as a national model, and based on program outcomes, Hrabowski has authored
numerous articles and co-authored two books, _Beating the Odds_ and _Overcoming
the Odds_ (Oxford University Press), focusing on parenting and high-achieving
African American males and females in science. His most recent book, _Holding
Fast to Dreams: Empowering Youth from the Civil Rights Crusade to STEM
Achievement_ (Beacon Press, 2015), describes the events and experiences that
played a central role in his development as an educator and leader.

The event is free and open to the public but [advance registration is
required](http://go.si.edu/site/Calendar?id=101581&view=Detail&s_src=nerdguide_web_cal_er). Space is limited.

An Evening With... is a signature series featuring thought leaders in
conversation with paleontologist and Sant Director of the National Museum of
Natural History, Kirk Johnson. This series invites audiences into the mindset of
a museum director grappling with leading a 19th century science museum into the
21st century. Dig into the thorny issues, uncover the mysteries, and ask bold
questions!
