excerpt: >
  On Nov 4, the Philosophical Society hosts Thomas Cronan for a talk on the
  visual capacities of other species, ranging from deep-sea shrimp ,who have no
  optics in their eyes yet see the hot water emerging from hydrothermal vents,
  to the many creatures that see ultraviolet light or image polarization
  patterns such as those a potential mate flashes when courting.

The [Philosophical Society of Washington](http://www.philsoc.org/)
Lectures are selected to
appeal to those with a general interest in science and do not require
a specialized knowledge of the subject. They always contain
information that is current, explanations that are understandable
and a few controversial issues to be challenged by a critical
listener. The series is designed as much as possible to include a
wide range of disciplines.

The meetings are open to the public, free, and no reservations are
required. Dress is informal. Meetings are followed by lively
conversation. All must exit the Cosmos Club at 10:30 p.m.
Conversations are continued at another location.

Many of us are certain that human eyes are at the evolutionary apex of animal
vision.  While we have rather good general purpose vision - able to see a speck
of dust on the window, provide a full experience of color space, sense motion so
quick that we can (some of us) successfully hit an approaching fastball out into
the bleachers, visualize a world lit with brilliant sunshine or dim starlight,
move rapidly from an interesting object to another one far from it, and capture
all the information in a scene - other animals badly outperform us in every one
of these abilities, and many in several of them - with each of their eyes at the
same time.

New imaging technologies and high-speed computers make it possible to enter the
visual worlds of species who see things very differently from the way we do.
This talk will discuss the visual capacities of other species, ranging from
deep-sea shrimp ,who have no optics in their eyes yet see the hot water emerging
from hydrothermal vents, to the many creatures that see ultraviolet light or
image polarization patterns such as those a potential mate flashes when
courting.  Much of the talk will be devoted to the astonishing eyes of the
mantis shrimps.  These creatures have two independently moving eyes that can see
color both in the range of light that we experience and in the ultraviolet.
They can also visualize two different kinds of polarized light, and either eye
by itself can measure distance.  The talk will employ a variety of imaging
techniques to illustrate in a way we humans can see, if only crudely, the visual
worlds inhabited by other animals.

Tom Cronin studies the visual physiology of invertebrates, especially marine and
estuarine crustaceans.  His research group’s motto is “If it has eyes, we can
study it!”  In recent years, his group has published papers on vision in squids,
butterflies, fiddler crabs, cuttlefish, primates, dolphins, orioles, reef
fishes, sponges, right whales, poison-dart frogs, fireflies, octopus, deep-sea
crabs, whooping cranes, and mantis shrimp.

Most of Tom’s recent work has been with the mantis shrimps (stomatopods), a
unique group of tropical crustaceans that have extremely complicated behavior
and perhaps the most unusual eyes ever evolved.  In particular, he has been
studying their color vision systems (which have many as 16 spectral channels),
their photic environments, their systems of color communication, the dynamics of
their photoreceptor cells, and their ocular movements and control systems.  He
and his research group also have begun studying molecular genetics of mantis
shrimp opsins, the photoreceptor proteins that underlie the visual detection of
light in these organisms.  The goal of this research is to learn how the
photoreceptors evolved and how these visual proteins are specialized for color
vision and for seeing the polarized-light signals that many species of mantis
shrimps produce.

The John Wesley Powell Auditorium is adjacent to the Cosmos Club, 2170 Florida
Avenue NW, Washington DC 20008. Entrance is through the club gate, the first
right-hand entrance on Florida Avenue north of the intersection with
Massachusetts Avenue NW. The auditorium entrance is to the left of the gate.
