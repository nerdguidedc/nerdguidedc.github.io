[Astronomy on Tap](http://astronomyontap.org/) is a gathering
for accessible, engaging science
presentations on topics ranging from planets to black holes to
galaxies to the beginning of the Universe. It's like [Nerd
Nite](https://nerdnite.com/) entirely for Astronomy. The Astronomy
on Tap series was created in NYC by Meg Schwamb, now a Postdoctoral
Fellow at the Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics,
Academia Sinica (Taiwan).

This is a 21+ event. Doors open at 7:30, talks begin at 8:00.
