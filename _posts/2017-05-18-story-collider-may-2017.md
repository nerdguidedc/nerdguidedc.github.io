excerpt: >
  Science surrounds us. Even when we don't notice it, science touches
  almost every part of our lives. Story Collider is on May 18, a live
  storytelling project and podcast that believes that everyone has a story to
  tell about science.

At the
[Story Collider](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-story-collider-risk-dc-may-2017-tickets-33244417949),
we believe that everyone has a story. From the tragic to the hilarious, we
explore the deeply human side of science.

We can all relate to the desire to feel comfortable, safe, secure. But what
about those moments when we took a chance and gambled with our relationships,
our futures, or even our lives?  This month we bring you stories that remind us
that on the road to reward, we all have to take some risks.

Stories By:

**Gretchen Goldman** is the research director at the Center for Science and
Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists, where she studies how science is
used and misused in policy making. When she’s not chasing around her
one-year-old son, Gretchen can be found biking across Washington, DC and
planning her next tourist adventure. She holds a PhD and MS in environmental
engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology and a BS in atmospheric
science from Cornell University. Follow her @GretchenTG.

**Tom Di Liberto** is a meteorologist, dad and improv performer. He is the winner of
AAAS’s first Science Idol competition. During the day, he is the consulting
meteorologist for Climate.gov at the Climate Prediction Center within the
National Weather Service. And he is at least partly responsible for everyone’s
recent obsession with El Niño. When he isn’t working at a governmental acronym
inside an acronym inside another acronym, you can find him on stage talking
about climate change or trying to get people to laugh as he attempts to make
something out of nothing. He also really likes clouds.

**Abbas Mousa** is an Economist at the Bureau of Economic Analysis. growing up in
Baghdad Iraq he always wanted to be an artist but ended up with a Computer
Science and Economic degrees, he's been featured on the Moth Radio Hour on NPR,
and with his passion for art and storytelling he became a regular storyteller
with the Moth StorySlam. Mousa immigrated to America in 2009 through a special
immigrant visa for Iraqi translators and currently working on his memoir, he has
been featured in multiple articles and a guest speaker sharing some of his
stories and experiences. Follow him on twitter @atmousa.

**Miranda Paley** is the managing editor of ACS Central Science, the first fully
open access journal of the American Chemical Society. She is a graduate of
Grinnell College and received her Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of
California, Irvine, where her research, focused on engineering the
light-generating enzyme from fireflies, called luciferase, to develop a tool
designed for tracking different cell populations in live animals. When she isn’t
writing press releases, organizing symposia or nagging overdue reviewers, you
can find her at her much beloved MINT DC gym, going to concerts or trying to
convince her cat-like dog to get up on couch with her. Follow her on twitter,
@paleymir (pronounced “polymer”).

**Dr. Rashawn Ray** is Associate Professor of Sociology, the Edward McK. Johnson,
Jr. Endowed Faculty Fellow, and Co-Director of the Critical Race Initiative at
the University of Maryland, College Park. Formerly, Ray was a Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation Health Policy Research Scholar at the University of
California, Berkeley. Ray’s research addresses the mechanisms that manufacture
and maintain racial and social inequality. His work also speaks to ways that
inequality may be attenuated through racial uplift activism and social policy.
Ray has published over 40 books, articles, book chapters, and op-eds. Currently,
Ray is co-investigator of a study examining implicit bias, body-worn cameras,
and police-citizen interactions with 1800 police officers with the Prince
George’s County Police Department.
