excerpt: >
  Dr. Elaine Ostrander’s team has taken advantage of naturally occurring
  variations in dog populations in order to reveal the genetic mechanisms
  underlying both simple and complex traits. On April 6, she will show how
  findings related to the genetic basis for canine disease, behavior, and
  morphologic traits frame our thinking of human growth regulation, disease, and
  population migration.

Since 1991, the Carnegie Institution has hosted extraordinary
researchers from a wide range of scientific disciplines as part
of the Capital Science Evenings lecture series. The lectures
provide a unique opportunity to connect with some of the most
gifted investigators in science and hear the stories behind
their discoveries.

All lectures are free and open to the public, and begin at 6:30 PM
at the Carnegie Institute for Science. Doors open at 6:00.
These hour-long lectures, followed by a brief
question and answer period, go beyond the media accounts for a
firsthand look at the “ah-ha” moments, the setbacks, and the triumphs
that drive brilliant minds and fundamentally change our understanding
of the world around us.

Registration is required. You can [register online](https://carnegiescience.edu/events/lectures/dog-genes-tell-surprising-tales-understanding-genetics-breed-behavior-shape-and).

#### Dog Genes Tell Surprising Tales: Understanding the Genetics of Breed Behavior, Shape, and Disease

Dr. Ostrander’s team has taken advantage of naturally occurring variations in
dog populations in order to reveal the genetic mechanisms underlying both simple
and complex traits. She will show how findings related to the genetic basis for
canine disease, behavior, and morphologic traits frame our thinking of human
growth regulation, disease, and population migration.
